[{"commit":{"message":"8264579: Use NEON vector load\/store to access small size memory\n\nFor vector load\/store with size 2\/4\/8\/16, we can directly use NEON\nload\/store instead of partial load\/store with predicate. Since\ncurrently we are still using different registers (vReg\/vecX\/vecD) for\nSVE and NEON codegen, we have to write different rules for NEON and\nSVE, though they are the same physical regs (sharing lower parts)."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64.ad"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_sve.ad"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_sve_ad.m4"}],"sha":"53d184b61778e56a8e31a8a894a668bc510d1387"}]
