[{"commit":{"message":"8263424: Extend vector size support for SVE\n\nThis patch adds support of vector operations with size less than\nMaxVectorSize for SVE. Basically, for general vector operations, we\nsimply keep original operations, i.e. doing a full vector length\noperations, but for load\/store and reduction operations, we use\npredicate operations to make sure only vector elements in the size\nlimit are loaded\/stored\/calculated.\n\nThis patch also fixes an SVE load\/store addressing mode usage issue.\nFor SVE load\/store scalar plus immediate, the immediate displacements\nare calculated by both vector element size and memory element size. As\nthe existing vmemA_immIOffset4 and vmemA_immLOffset4 does not take into\naccount of the vector and memory element size difference, we should not\nuse them for extend\/narrow forms.\n\nTested with tier1 and jdk:tier3. jdk\/incubator\/vector cases have also\nbeen verified with different MaxVectorSize options."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64.ad"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_neon.ad"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_neon_ad.m4"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_sve.ad"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_sve_ad.m4"}],"sha":"c41631946839b9526995d11077d19e7f8ed4551f"}]
