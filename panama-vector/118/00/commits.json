[{"commit":{"message":"8272869: AArch64: Mark masked rearrange operation as unsupported\n\nThis patch marks masked rearrange operation as unsupported for AArch64,\nthe reasons are as follows:\n\n1. AArch64 dose not have predicated 'tbl' instruction\n2. Mid-end has transformed masked VectorRearrange into VectorBlend[1]\n   for those platforms which are missing corresponding instructions.\n\nGiven by this, there's no need to add backend support for masked\nVectorRearrange, and the final generated code as below:\n\n```\n        tbl     z16.s, {z20.s}, z16.s\n        mov     z17.s, #0\n        sel     z16.s, p2, z16.s, z17.s\n```\n\n[1] https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/panama-vector\/blob\/vectorIntrinsics%2Bmask\/src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/vectorIntrinsics.cpp#L2016\n\nChange-Id: Ib63e8950be0d49af18155a9562a9157986448ac3"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_sve.ad"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_sve_ad.m4"}],"sha":"50a2e36ee43c133e2d9c9303f4875e256413b3d0"}]
