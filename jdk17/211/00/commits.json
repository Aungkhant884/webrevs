[{"commit":{"message":"8268966: AArch64: 'bad AD file' in some vector conversion tests\n\nJVM crashes with 'bad AD file' on some vector api test cases with\n'Xcomp' option. Further analysis shows that, there are some missing\nrules for vector conversion. Since we are now in jdk 17 RDP 1, it would\nbe better to mark them as unsupported for now and add match rules in\nfuture. Test cases also added to verify the conversion between types.\n\nChange-Id: I2f90bd5936a927fbec9ca994db7d10224ab2b42c"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64.ad"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/vectorapi\/VectorCastShape128Test.java"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/vectorapi\/VectorCastShape64Test.java"}],"sha":"52788702c11683fbf0e79dca07e75cf1fd8fc334"}]
