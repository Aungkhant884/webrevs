From 1909-05-01 (00:00:00\n-# Amsterdam mean time) onwards, the whole of the Netherlands (including\n-# the Dutch railways) was required by law to observe Amsterdam mean time\n-# (19 minutes 32.13 seconds ahead of GMT). This had already been the\n-# common practice (except for the railways) for many decades but it was\n-# not until 1909 when the Dutch government finally defined this by law.\n-# On 1937-07-01 this was changed to 20 minutes (exactly) ahead of GMT and\n-# was generally known as Dutch Time (\"Nederlandse Tijd\").\n-#\n-# (2001-04-08):\n-# 1892-05-01 was the date when the Dutch railways were by law required to\n-# observe GMT while the remainder of the Netherlands adhered to the common\n-# practice of following Amsterdam mean time.\n-#\n-# (2001-04-09):\n-# In 1835 the authorities of the province of North Holland requested the\n-# municipal authorities of the towns and cities in the province to observe\n-# Amsterdam mean time but I do not know in how many cases this request was\n-# actually followed.\n-#\n-# From 1852 onwards the Dutch telegraph offices were by law required to\n-# observe Amsterdam mean time. As the time signals from the observatory of\n-# Leiden were also distributed by the telegraph system, I assume that most\n-# places linked up with the telegraph (and railway) system automatically\n-# adopted Amsterdam mean time.\n-#\n-# Although the early Dutch railway companies initially observed a variety\n-# of times, most of them had adopted Amsterdam mean time by 1858 but it\n-# was not until 1866 when they were all required by law to observe\n-# Amsterdam mean time.\n-\n-# The data entries before 1945 are taken from\n-# https:\/\/www.staff.science.uu.nl\/~gent0113\/wettijd\/wettijd.htm\n-\n-# From Paul Eggert (2021-05-09):\n-# I invented the abbreviations AMT for Amsterdam Mean Time and NST for\n-# Netherlands Summer Time, used in the Netherlands from 1835 to 1937.\n-\n-# Rule\tNAME\tFROM\tTO\t-\tIN\tON\tAT\tSAVE\tLETTER\/S\n-Rule\tNeth\t1916\tonly\t-\tMay\t 1\t0:00\t1:00\tNST\t# Netherlands Summer Time\n-Rule\tNeth\t1916\tonly\t-\tOct\t 1\t0:00\t0\tAMT\t# Amsterdam Mean Time\n-Rule\tNeth\t1917\tonly\t-\tApr\t16\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-Rule\tNeth\t1917\tonly\t-\tSep\t17\t2:00s\t0\tAMT\n-Rule\tNeth\t1918\t1921\t-\tApr\tMon>=1\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-Rule\tNeth\t1918\t1921\t-\tSep\tlastMon\t2:00s\t0\tAMT\n-Rule\tNeth\t1922\tonly\t-\tMar\tlastSun\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-Rule\tNeth\t1922\t1936\t-\tOct\tSun>=2\t2:00s\t0\tAMT\n-Rule\tNeth\t1923\tonly\t-\tJun\tFri>=1\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-Rule\tNeth\t1924\tonly\t-\tMar\tlastSun\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-Rule\tNeth\t1925\tonly\t-\tJun\tFri>=1\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-# From 1926 through 1939 DST began 05-15, except that it was delayed by a week\n-# in years when 05-15 fell in the Pentecost weekend.\n-Rule\tNeth\t1926\t1931\t-\tMay\t15\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-Rule\tNeth\t1932\tonly\t-\tMay\t22\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-Rule\tNeth\t1933\t1936\t-\tMay\t15\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-Rule\tNeth\t1937\tonly\t-\tMay\t22\t2:00s\t1:00\tNST\n-Rule\tNeth\t1937\tonly\t-\tJul\t 1\t0:00\t1:00\tS\n-Rule\tNeth\t1937\t1939\t-\tOct\tSun>=2\t2:00s\t0\t-\n-Rule\tNeth\t1938\t1939\t-\tMay\t15\t2:00s\t1:00\tS\n-Rule\tNeth\t1945\tonly\t-\tApr\t 2\t2:00s\t1:00\tS\n-Rule\tNeth\t1945\tonly\t-\tSep\t16\t2:00s\t0\t-\n-#\n-# Amsterdam Mean Time was +00:19:32.13, but the .13 is omitted\n-# below because the current format requires STDOFF to be an integer.\n-# Zone\tNAME\t\tSTDOFF\tRULES\tFORMAT\t[UNTIL]\n-Zone Europe\/Amsterdam\t0:19:32 -\tLMT\t1835\n-\t\t\t0:19:32\tNeth\t%s\t1937 Jul  1\n-\t\t\t0:20\tNeth +0020\/+0120 1940 May 16  0:00\n-\t\t\t1:00\tC-Eur\tCE%sT\t1945 Apr  2  2:00\n-\t\t\t1:00\tNeth\tCE%sT\t1977\n-\t\t\t1:00\tEU\tCE%sT\n+# See Europe\/Brussels.\n@@ -2221,16 +1972,1 @@\n-# http:\/\/met.no\/met\/met_lex\/q_u\/sommertid.html (2004-01) agrees with Shanks &\n-# Pottenger.\n-# Rule\tNAME\tFROM\tTO\t-\tIN\tON\tAT\tSAVE\tLETTER\/S\n-Rule\tNorway\t1916\tonly\t-\tMay\t22\t1:00\t1:00\tS\n-Rule\tNorway\t1916\tonly\t-\tSep\t30\t0:00\t0\t-\n-Rule\tNorway\t1945\tonly\t-\tApr\t 2\t2:00s\t1:00\tS\n-Rule\tNorway\t1945\tonly\t-\tOct\t 1\t2:00s\t0\t-\n-Rule\tNorway\t1959\t1964\t-\tMar\tSun>=15\t2:00s\t1:00\tS\n-Rule\tNorway\t1959\t1965\t-\tSep\tSun>=15\t2:00s\t0\t-\n-Rule\tNorway\t1965\tonly\t-\tApr\t25\t2:00s\t1:00\tS\n-# Zone\tNAME\t\tSTDOFF\tRULES\tFORMAT\t[UNTIL]\n-Zone\tEurope\/Oslo\t0:43:00 -\tLMT\t1895 Jan  1\n-\t\t\t1:00\tNorway\tCE%sT\t1940 Aug 10 23:00\n-\t\t\t1:00\tC-Eur\tCE%sT\t1945 Apr  2  2:00\n-\t\t\t1:00\tNorway\tCE%sT\t1980\n-\t\t\t1:00\tEU\tCE%sT\n+# See Europe\/Berlin.\n@@ -2283,1 +2019,1 @@\n-# All these events predate our cutoff date of 1970, so use Europe\/Oslo\n+# All these events predate our cutoff date of 1970, so use Europe\/Berlin\n@@ -2285,1 +2021,1 @@\n-Link\tEurope\/Oslo\tArctic\/Longyearbyen\n+\n@@ -2339,1 +2075,0 @@\n-# Round the old offset to -0:36:45.
