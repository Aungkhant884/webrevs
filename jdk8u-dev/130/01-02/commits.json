[{"commit":{"message":"8253714: [cgroups v2] Soft memory limit incorrectly using memory.high\n\nThe early implementation of cgroups v2 support was done with\ncrun 0.8 and it contained a bug which set memory.high over\nmemory.low when --memory-reservation was being used as a CLI\noption.\n\nThis bug has been fixed in later crun versions, starting with\ncrun 0.11. Use memory.low in OpenJDK as well.\n\nBackport-of: ff6843ca4842498791061f924c545fa9469cc1dc"},"files":[],"sha":"b6adc37193e5d5932bde4ebc44ea0ffbc0195089"}]
