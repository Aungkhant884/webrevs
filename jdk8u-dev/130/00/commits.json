[{"commit":{"message":"8253714: [cgroups v2] Soft memory limit incorrectly using memory.high\n\nThe early implementation of cgroups v2 support was done with\ncrun 0.8 and it contained a bug which set memory.high over\nmemory.low when --memory-reservation was being used as a CLI\noption.\n\nThis bug has been fixed in later crun versions, starting with\ncrun 0.11. Use memory.low in OpenJDK as well.\n\nBackport-of: ff6843ca4842498791061f924c545fa9469cc1dc"},"files":[{"filename":"hotspot\/src\/os\/linux\/vm\/cgroupV2Subsystem_linux.cpp"},{"filename":"jdk\/src\/linux\/classes\/jdk\/internal\/platform\/cgroupv2\/CgroupV2Subsystem.java"},{"filename":"jdk\/test\/lib\/jdk\/test\/lib\/containers\/cgroup\/MetricsTesterCgroupV2.java"}],"sha":"f1344e0ecd76b0dddddb55386b75454093e14b62"}]
