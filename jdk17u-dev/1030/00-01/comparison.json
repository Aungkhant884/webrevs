Manually copy that in.\n+\n+Some re-editing of these updated files will be needed.\n+Use \"expand\" and \"sed\" to remove tabs and trailing white space from the imported files.\n+Re-apply the GPL headers used by the JDK. If done correctly these should then not\n+show up in the PR diff.\n+\n+Update src\/java.desktop\/share\/legal\/lcms.md per the current license\/copyrights\/attributions etc.\n+\n+Build on all platforms.\n+If there are compiler warnings causing build failures, update the disabled warnings in\n+make\/modules\/java.desktop\/lib\/Awt2dLibraries.gmk\n+Run all automated client tests on all platforms.\n+Also run J2Ddemo and pay particular attention to the \"color\" tab.\n+Visually verify the color transforms against the same with the current\/previous JDK\n\\ No newline at end of file\n","filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/native\/liblcms\/UPDATING.txt","additions":23,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":23,"status":"added"}]}
