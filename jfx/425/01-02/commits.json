Added a third probe (after Command and\nShift+Command) to look for letters that require Option. The\nkeyboards in question are Azeri, Turkmen, and the Sami layouts."},"files":[{"filename":"modules\/javafx.graphics\/src\/main\/native-glass\/mac\/GlassKey.m"}],"sha":"26a6fb0d0ad7768fff6362bdb4e423db0d9cc984"}]
