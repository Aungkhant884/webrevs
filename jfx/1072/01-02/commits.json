The calculated values for properties with a user set value were\nomitted in the cache entry, and other nodes that later share the same\nentry would incorrectly assume the omitted property was unstyled and\nwere therefore reset to their default values."},"files":[],"sha":"e0bb42d9b1ae109fc259ab8570a19f0ac71a41e9"}]
