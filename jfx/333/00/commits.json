[{"commit":{"message":"1. Making the delay as 1 sec instead of 2 sec as it seems to pass on all systems. 2. Increasing the total test time to 2 minutes 3. Made chances so that each call to Util.runAndWait has only one edge checked. This should allow 10 sec for one edge, which should be enough on slower machines too."},"files":[{"filename":"tests\/system\/src\/test\/java\/test\/robot\/javafx\/scene\/MouseLocationOnScreenTest.java"}],"sha":"4992e528639f1352ab8867f914a480001a60112b"},{"commit":{"message":"8213573: MouseLocationOnScreenTest fails intermittently"},"files":[{"filename":"tests\/system\/src\/test\/java\/test\/robot\/javafx\/scene\/MouseLocationOnScreenTest.java"}],"sha":"3de06ab749c8d9c2d686d21f7731376ff8cf3080"}]
