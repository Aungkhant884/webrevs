It is important to document either if callers can rely on runLater to do such synchronisation\r\ninternally, or to document is users CAN NOT rely on runLater for this.\r\n\r\nThis change documents that actions in a thread prior to submitting a runnable to\r\nPlatform#runLater happen-before actions performed by the runnable in the JavaFX\r\nApplication Thread.\r\n\r\nrunLater inherits the memory consistency effects of InvokeLaterDispatcher in most cases. \r\nInvokeLaterDispatcher uses BlockingDeque internally. This change documents this\r\nin the same way as it is documented by BlockingDeque.\r\n\r\nOther implementations of runLater should have similar memory consistency effects."},"files":[{"filename":"modules\/javafx.graphics\/src\/main\/java\/javafx\/application\/Platform.java"}],"sha":"b5a937590a2174aa0ef24e7d6522b4322e04c718"}]
