[{"commit":{"message":"Try to keep visible cells at their original position when improving the estimate.\nThis reduces annoying effects when re-layouting cells without relevant changes.\n\nThis should not be done when we don't have a valid estimate yet\/anymore,\nor when the absoluteOffset is set to infinity (which may happen if the\nposition is set to infinity, which is the case in some calls in Skin classes)."},"files":[{"filename":"modules\/javafx.controls\/src\/main\/java\/javafx\/scene\/control\/skin\/VirtualFlow.java"},{"filename":"modules\/javafx.controls\/src\/test\/java\/test\/javafx\/scene\/control\/ListViewTest.java"}],"sha":"c7d722d33d98323b659646e5cffe55dd4caeb49a"}]
