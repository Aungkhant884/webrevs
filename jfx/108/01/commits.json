[{"commit":{"message":"JDK-8185886\n\nExpressionHelper.Generic now uses a Map for speed rather than linear\nsearching through an array.\n\nWe use a LinkedHashMap<Listener, Integer> in ExpressionHelper.Generic.\nThis ensures we can iterate through the map in insertion order to call back\nlisteners in the order they were registered (although this isn't a requirement\naccording to the spec, I got unit test failures when I used a HashMap instead).\n\nIt also allow us to keep track if the same listener has been registerd more than\nonce and hence honour the addListener and removeListener requirements.\nSpecifically:\n\naddListener:\nIf the same listener is added more than once, then it will be notified more than once. That is, no check is made to ensure uniqueness.\n\nremoveLister:\nIf it had been added more than once, then only the first occurrence will be removed.\n\nCheck in unit tests to test the case where the same listener is registered\/removed multiple times"},"files":[{"filename":"modules\/javafx.base\/src\/main\/java\/com\/sun\/javafx\/binding\/ExpressionHelper.java"},{"filename":"modules\/javafx.base\/src\/main\/java\/com\/sun\/javafx\/binding\/ExpressionHelperBase.java"},{"filename":"modules\/javafx.base\/src\/test\/java\/test\/com\/sun\/javafx\/binding\/ExpressionHelperTest.java"},{"filename":"modules\/javafx.base\/src\/test\/java\/test\/com\/sun\/javafx\/binding\/ExpressionHelperUtility.java"}],"sha":"05c371968a5c7b9d265ef0429a856093d0f7513b"}]
