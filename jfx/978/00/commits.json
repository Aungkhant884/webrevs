[{"commit":{"message":"8231864: JavaFX Labels in Tab's VBox is not displayed until it is clicked\n\nCreating a not-displayed node and then modifying its contents caused JFX to\nnot consume its old dirty region and thus not update it. When such node was\ndisplayed, its old dirty region was used for drawing, which in some cases\n(ex. new content taking more space) caused it to clip.\n\nResolved by always unionizing dirty regions with new bounds."},"files":[{"filename":"modules\/javafx.graphics\/src\/main\/java\/com\/sun\/javafx\/sg\/prism\/NGNode.java"}],"sha":"1fa43f3b15c948fca5984162f5e6710438592d9c"}]
