[{"commit":{"message":"Updated according to review comments\n\n- The text and formatting was adjusted according to the raised concerns.\n- The test was modified with a 15000ms timeout as is the case for other\n  tests in the systemTests project\n- A safeguard was added in the launched child JVM, that terminates the\n  child after 15000ms is it did not exit normally\n- The detection of a successful test was moved to a ChangeLister on the\n  load worker state. It is assumed, that the worker success state is\n  similar to the DOMContentLoaded event. The latter is fired after\n  synchronous javascript was executed and that would be late enough to\n  \"see\" the DOM update of the title.\n\nIt was validated, that the test still fails without the fix and succeeds\nwith it."},"files":[{"filename":"modules\/javafx.web\/src\/main\/native\/Source\/WTF\/wtf\/java\/MainThreadJava.cpp"},{"filename":"tests\/system\/src\/test\/java\/test\/com\/sun\/webkit\/MainThreadTest.java"},{"filename":"tests\/system\/src\/testapp7\/java\/mymod\/myapp7\/DataUrlWithModuleLayer.java"},{"filename":"tests\/system\/src\/testapp7\/java\/mymod\/myapp7\/DataUrlWithModuleLayerLauncher.java"}],"sha":"8e688e94ed789104c0a55e9deca91530d9f75bf3"}]
