But I don't think it's needed.\n\nThis limitation was added in [1]. Frankly speaking, I don't know the\nreason. But I guess the assertion is probably used for debugging,\nraising one warning of fmovs\/fmovd usage in the scenario of moving\nelement at index zero from one **vector** register, to one float-point\nscalar register. If the \"src\" vector register and the \"dst\" float-point\nscalar register are the same one, it introduces a side-effect, i.e. the\nhigher bits are cleared to zeros[2].\n\nIf so, I argue that\n1) the assembler should align with the ISA.\n2) compiler developers should be aware of the side-effect when they want\nto use fmovs\/fmovd, and they should guarantee \"dst != src\" if they like\nto higher bits untouched, e.g., [3].\n\nHence, I think we can remove this unnecessary assertion.\n\n[1] http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/aarch64-port\/jdk8\/hotspot\/rev\/9baee4e65ac5\n[2] https:\/\/developer.arm.com\/documentation\/ddi0596\/2021-12\/SIMD-FP-Instructions\/FMOV--register---Floating-point-Move-register-without-conversion-?lang=en\n[3] https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_sve.ad#L4899"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/assembler_aarch64.hpp"}],"sha":"58361d8b616bf6bb84fe4b1b3ed7515182638218"}]
