[{"commit":{"message":"8259288: Debug build failure with clang-10 due to -Wimplicit-int-float-conversion\n\nMaking the conversion explicit would fix it.\n\nFlag '-Wimplicit-int-float-conversion' is first introduced in clang-10.\nTherefore clang-8 and clang-9 are not affected. The flag with similar\nfunctionality in gcc is '-Wfloat-conversion', but it is not enabled by\n'-Wall' or '-Wextra'. That's why this warning does not apprear when\nbuilding with gcc."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/runtime\/threadHeapSampler.cpp"}],"sha":"99259621667b82d0425c08a8722f0d23ada1ff6a"}]
