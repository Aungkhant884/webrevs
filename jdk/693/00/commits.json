[{"commit":{"message":"8254805: compiler\/debug\/TestStressCM.java is still failing\n\nUse the code motion trace produced by TraceOptoPipelining (excluding traces of\nstubs) to assert that two compilations with the same seed cause StressLCM and\nStressGCM to take the same randomized decisions. Previously, the entire output\nproduced by PrintOptoStatistics was used instead, which has shown to be too\nfragile. Also, disable inlining in both TestStressCM.java and the similar\nTestStressIGVN.java to prevent flaky behavior, and run both tests for ten\ndifferent seeds to improve coverage."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/debug\/TestStressCM.java"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/debug\/TestStressIGVN.java"}],"sha":"499b95b45d9ae24317ce50107222c048c2437ca0"}]
