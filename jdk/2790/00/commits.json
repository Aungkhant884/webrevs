[{"commit":{"message":"8261689: javax\/swing\/JComponent\/7154030\/bug7154030.java still fails with \"Exception: Failed to hide opaque button\"\n\nSlightly adjusted the sequence of the waiting plus set specific min\/max\nsizes on the component and frame. That should get rid of the incomplete\npainting at the start. Also added the additional screen capture that\nshould show the state of the application after initialization and the\narea that will be analyzed."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/jdk\/javax\/swing\/JComponent\/7154030\/bug7154030.java"}],"sha":"c0a2cd4e1c08b644d997f3810805cbf752317274"}]
