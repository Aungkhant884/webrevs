The\nadapters may not be allocated in `loadClass`, and VirtualMachineError\nhas been thrown but wrapped in LambdaConversionException\n(`InnerClassLambdaMetafactory.buildCallSite`) and BootstrapMethodError\n(`BootstrapMethodInvoker.invoke`).\nVirtualMachineError may not be completely printed by `printStackTrace`\nin `ThreadGroup.uncaughtException` before the process terminated. This\nbreaks the expected scenario 2.\n\nThe check of scenario 2 is removed from the test as it's not reliable.\n\nThe test has passed as below.\n```\nmake test \\\n    TEST=\"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/codecache\/CodeCacheFullCountTest.java\" \\\n    JTREG=\"JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xcomp -ea -esa -XX:-TieredCompilation\"\n```"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/codecache\/CodeCacheFullCountTest.java"}],"sha":"8aff298b2ebbf1db7f050a8bcdb629b594af641a"}]
