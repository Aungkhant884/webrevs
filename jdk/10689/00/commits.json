[{"commit":{"message":"8295262: Build binutils out of source tree\n\nCurrently, when passing --with-binutils-src, binutils is built in the source tree. That leads to conflicting targets when compiling for different architectures (ex: amd64 on the host, and riscv64 or aarch64 for the target) from the same jdk source tree.\n\nThe simplest solution is to build binutils out-of-tree and into the build\/<target>\/binutils folder. These out-of-tree builds are already supported by binutils and only require some changes in the way we invoke the binutils\/configure command."},"files":[{"filename":"make\/autoconf\/lib-hsdis.m4"},{"filename":"src\/utils\/hsdis\/binutils\/hsdis-binutils.c"}],"sha":"b69fdbaa3db5717114dea69e6f849135cbd3ad87"}]
