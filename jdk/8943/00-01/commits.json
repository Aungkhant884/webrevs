[{"commit":{"message":"JDK-8264999: GeneralPath.lineTo() to itself produces jagged lines\n\nAdding \"&& prev == DRAWING_OP_TO\" per Laurent's code review.\n\nI also redid the unit tests. Before this change, with the new unit tests: one scenario failed. With this change: four scenarios failed.\n\nFor now I've commented out the failing tests. The failing tests are not the same as the original bug; they are related considerations we should also test against, but IMO they are not essential for the resolution of jdk-8264999."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/sun\/java2d\/marlin\/Stroker.java"},{"filename":"test\/jdk\/sun\/java2d\/marlin\/JoinMiterRedundantLineSegmentsTest.java"}],"sha":"c7e3527550de81142f34e5f7baed98939cc14906"}]
