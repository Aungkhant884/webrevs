[{"commit":{"message":"JDK-8264999: GeneralPath.lineTo() to itself produces jagged lines\n\nPreviously when you drew a line that moved exactly (+0, +0) with a miter stroke the Stroker class acted like a horizontal miter was appropriate. Now we abort instead, so no miter is applied.\n\nThe new unit test tests the original steps plus several variations.\n\nI'm a little nervous about this change because it looks like someone previously considered this exact condition and implemented a different behavior. I don't think I understand the original rationale."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/sun\/java2d\/marlin\/Stroker.java"},{"filename":"test\/jdk\/sun\/java2d\/marlin\/JoinMiterRedundantLineSegmentsTest.java"}],"sha":"7c29da9da1ccf34908d754e3e023496076f1b937"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #3 from openjdk\/master\n\nMerge from openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"57346a421446d51192ceada277626ba1ae92d8d7"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #2 from openjdk\/master\n\nMerge openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"333c87c2107262532815db6978c5e8f59c5a967e"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #1 from openjdk\/master\n\nMerge openjdk\/jdk into mickleness\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"5dbf0a67ad41a53e03f02c41b1b6364fc3a633ee"}]
