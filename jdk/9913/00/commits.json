[{"commit":{"message":"8292511: AArch64: Align CPU feature name for NEON with hwcap\n\nAArch64 hwcap uses `asimd` to represent the CPU feature of NEON. But in\nvm_version_aarch64.hpp, this name is redefined as `simd`. This renaming\nlooks trivial but can easily lead to bugs in test cases as more and more\npeople start writing jtreg IR tests today.\n\nFor example, if someone just finds CPU feature name from some documents\nor `\/proc\/cpuinfo`, and writes below annotations in his test case, the\ntest case won't run on AArch64.\n- `@requires vm.cpu.features ~= \".*asimd.*\"`\n- `@IR(applyIfCPUFeature = {\"asimd\", \"true\"}, counts = {...})`\n\nSo in this patch we propose to align the CPU feature names. Some related\njtreg cases are also updated. There's another misalignment of the names\nfor CPU feature `sha2`. We don't change it as we have some discussions\nin https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.org\/browse\/JDK-8285266 .\n\nTested tier1 and hotspot:compiler\/vectorapi on x86 and AArch64."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/vm_version_aarch64.hpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/vectorapi\/AllBitsSetVectorMatchRuleTest.java"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/vectorapi\/TestReverseByteTransforms.java"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/vectorapi\/VectorLogicalOpIdentityTest.java"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/vectorapi\/reshape\/TestVectorCastNeon.java"}],"sha":"06cf5b5852f59d3637c80ec1c0a6d591b2ce1f74"}]
