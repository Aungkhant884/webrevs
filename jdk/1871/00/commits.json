[{"commit":{"message":"8259354: Fix race condition in AbstractEventStream.nextThreadName\n\nThe result of `AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()` is used rather than\nincrementing the long and reading its value separately. The\nprevious approach allowed for the static counter to be incremented\nseveral times before any caller read the value, resulting in\nseveral callers with the same value."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/jdk.jfr\/share\/classes\/jdk\/jfr\/internal\/consumer\/AbstractEventStream.java"}],"sha":"24f074845b67d176a86df15ed1d4c75a2e8325ef"}]
