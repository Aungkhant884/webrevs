[{"commit":{"message":"Reverse the order of safepoint_check_required and allow_vm_block arguments so that the first can imply the value of the second.

Also remove default arguments as they are evil."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/gtest\/runtime\/test_mutex.cpp"}],"sha":"220aca8c81e7c628eb40ac1ee6bf4ce7ec86b902"}]
