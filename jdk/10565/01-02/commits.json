I've added an inverse method to remove the colors and font to call for the uninstallDefaults methods that install defaults.\n\nAquaButtonUI can call its super since it would otherwise be repeated code. BasicComboBoxUI (weirdly) installs the properties again when it should be uninstalling them, so I changed.\n\nI noticed that, in a few subclasses, only one of calls to the super of installDefaults and uninstallDefaults are made. That is, an overridden installDefaults may call its super while the overridden uninstallDefaults does not call its super (or vise versa). These classes are: AquaTabbedPaneUI, SynthMenuItemUI, SynthSplitPaneUI, and XTextAreaPeer."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/javax\/swing\/plaf\/basic\/BasicPanelUI.java"}],"sha":"d9ee900e28c18391e2aeae38daa84ea359871ebd"}]
