[{"commit":{"message":"Handle more StrIntrinsic nodes which use AllocateArray of String.\n\nThere are a few subclasses of StrIntrinsicNode. They may be users of\nj.l.String::value, eg StrEqualsNode and StrCompNode etc. This patch\ntreats them as general nodes.\n\nThis patch fixes TestOptimizeSubstring.java failure with -Xcomp.\nThe test methods were not properly inlined or pruned in presence of -Xcomp.\nThis patch provides more fine-grained control to make sure those methods are compiled more reliablely."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/arraycopynode.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/macro.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/macro.hpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/c2\/TestOptimizeSubstring.java"}],"sha":"94626e87cea669a94f02ed6737a5845d0a2a59a9"}]
