[{"commit":{"message":"8311130: AArch64: Sync SVE related CPU features with VM options\n\nAs discussed in PR #14533, keeping AArch64 flag `UseSVE` and its related\nCPU features in sync helps to simplify rules in IR tests. In this patch,\nwe mask SVE related CPU features off if specified SVE level in VM option\nis lower than the hardware supported. Also, to support this change, we\nmove the features string construction to the end of the `initialize()`\nfunction.\n\nWe also revert IR rule changes in PR #14533 and fix some code styles. We\ntested almost full jtreg on SVE, SVE2 and non-SVE CPUs and no new issue\nis found after this patch."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/vm_version_aarch64.cpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/arguments\/TestSyncCPUFeaturesWithSVEFlags.java"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/vectorapi\/VectorLogicalOpIdentityTest.java"}],"sha":"379fa9cef65d93155b5e634fa03abcd39ef134f1"}]
