Any properties below that take a numeric value\n+ * assume the default value if given a string that does not parse as a number.\n+ * <ul>\n+ * <li><p><b>{@systemProperty sun.net.httpserver.idleInterval}<\/b> (default: 30 sec)<br>\n+ * Maximum duration in seconds which an idle connection is kept open. This timer\n+ * has an implementation specific granularity that may mean that idle connections are\n+ * closed later than the specified interval. Values less than or equal to zero are mapped\n+ * to the default setting.\n+ * <\/li>\n+ * <li><p><b>{@systemProperty jdk.httpserver.maxConnections}<\/b> (default: -1)<br>\n+ * The maximum number of open connections at a time. This includes active and idle connections.\n+ * If zero or negative, then no limit is enforced.\n+ * <\/li>\n+ * <li><p><b>{@systemProperty sun.net.httpserver.maxIdleConnections}<\/b> (default: 200)<br>\n+ * The maximum number of idle connections at a time. If set to zero or a negative value\n+ * then connections are closed after use.\n+ * <\/li>\n+ * <li><p><b>{@systemProperty sun.net.httpserver.drainAmount}<\/b> (default: 65536)<br>\n+ * The maximum number of bytes that will be automatically read and discarded from a\n+ * request body that has not been completely consumed by its\n+ * {@link com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler HttpHandler}. If the number of remaining\n+ * unread bytes are less than this limit then the connection will be put in the idle connection\n+ * cache. If not, then it will be closed.\n+ * <\/li>\n+ * <li><p><b>{@systemProperty sun.net.httpserver.maxReqHeaders}<\/b> (default: 200)<br>\n+ * The maxiumum number of header fields accepted in a request. If this limit is exceeded\n+ * while the headers are being read, then the connection is terminated and the request ignored.\n+ * If the value is less than or equal to zero, then the default value is used.\n+ * <\/li>\n+ * <li><p><b>{@systemProperty sun.net.httpserver.maxReqTime}<\/b> (default: -1)<br>\n+ * The maximum time in milliseconds allowed to receive a request headers and body.\n+ * In practice, the actual time is a function of request size, network speed, and handler\n+ * processing delays. A value less than or equal to zero means the time is not limited.\n+ * If the limit is exceeded then the connection is terminated and the handler will receive a\n+ * {@link java.io.IOException}. This timer has an implementation specific granularity\n+ * that may mean requests are aborted later than the specified interval.\n+ * <\/li>\n+ * <li><p><b>{@systemProperty sun.net.httpserver.maxRspTime}<\/b> (default: -1)<br>\n+ * The maximum time in milliseconds allowed to receive a response headers and body.\n+ * In practice, the actual time is a function of response size, network speed, and handler\n+ * processing delays. A value less than or equal to zero means the time is not limited.\n+ * If the limit is exceeded then the connection is terminated and the handler will receive a\n+ * {@link java.io.IOException}.
