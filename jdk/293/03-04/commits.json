[{"commit":{"message":"Per Martin Doerr's v4 review: fix regression, and speed up return time for buffers that are too small\n\n - Check for case where the result of subtacting 12 off of the source\n   length produces a negative number.  To do this efficiently, I added the\n   instruction definition for mcrxrx, which is implemented on Power9+.\n\n - Rearrange the code so that minimal initialization is performed before\n   checking the size, so that the intrinsic can return quickly in the event\n   that the buffer is too small to process."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/ppc\/assembler_ppc.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/ppc\/assembler_ppc.inline.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/ppc\/stubGenerator_ppc.cpp"}],"sha":"b5acb75c7b6abaa65a3460eddcb56beb776c0928"}]
