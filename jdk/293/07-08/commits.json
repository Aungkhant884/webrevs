[{"commit":{"message":"stubGenerator_ppc.cpp: Remove the predicted branch around the xxsel instruction to improves performance by about 9%\n\nThis conditional branch around the xxsel seemed like a good idea at the\ntime, because I thought the branch would be less costly than the xxsel\ninstruction, but it turns out not to be the case; executing the xxsel every\ntime without a conditional branch increases performance by about 9%.\nRemoving that branch also removed the need for the declaration and usage of\nan array of Label's for the branch destinations inside the unrolled code."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/ppc\/stubGenerator_ppc.cpp"}],"sha":"0e291be4f682a65538811ec00d2b3ac428a98bd4"},{"commit":{"message":"stubGenerator_ppc.cpp: address issues with understanding the pack algorithm\n\n * Change the order of the bytes as listed in the tables, which makes the\n   use of vpextd easier to understand.\n\n * Because the byte order of the constants used in the tables is reversed from\n   the original documentation, change the constant declarations to match the order\n   in the table, by using the ARRAY_TO_LXV_ORDER macro.
