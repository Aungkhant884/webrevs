[{"commit":{"message":"8285246: AArch64: remove overflow check from InterpreterMacroAssembler::increment_mdp_data_at\n\nSeveral reasons to do this:\n\n- A 64-bit counter is realistically never going to overflow in the\n  interpreter.  The PPC64 port also doesn't check for overflow for this\n  reason.\n\n- It's inconsistent with C1 which does not check for overflow.  (See\n  e.g. LIRGenerator::profile_branch() which does `__ leal(...)` to add\n  and explicitly doesn't set the flags.)\n\n- We're checking for 64-bit overflow as the MDO cells are word-sized but\n  accessors like BranchData::taken() silently truncate to uint which is\n  32 bit.  So I don't think this check is doing anything useful.\n\n- I'd like to experiment with using LSE far atomics to update the MDO\n  counters here, but the overflow check prevents that.\n\nTested jtreg tier1-3 and also verified that the counters for a\nparticular test method were the same before and after when run with\n-Xbatch."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/interp_masm_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"f61fcf1cf40132b65f94e90bcce7e0be65469168"}]
