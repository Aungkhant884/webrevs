[{"commit":{"message":"Moved all rects and lines 0.5 pixel\n\nThe 'shape-rendering: crispEdges' did give crisp edges in 100% scale,\nbut in 200% scale some edges are 3-pixel wide and others are 2-pixel.\nUsing 0.5 pixel offset solves both problems. I verified rendering on\n100%-scale display as well as on 150%- and 200%-scale displays."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/javax\/swing\/text\/doc-files\/Document-remove.svg"}],"sha":"9ccad364b5457fe8f2e165ac92158c13277926c0"}]
