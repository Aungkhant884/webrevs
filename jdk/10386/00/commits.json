[{"commit":{"message":"8293887: AArch64 build failure with GCC 12 due to maybe-uninitialized warning in libfdlibm k_rem_pio2.c\n\nThis warning seems to be a false positive, because 1) array \"fq\" with\nelements from index 0 to \"jz\" has already been initialized as \"fw\" at\nline 290 [1], and 2) variable \"jz\" should be non-negative from the\ncomment at line 99 [2].\n\nNote-1: GCC warning option -Wmaybe-uninitialized is not a new one.\nNote-2: x86-64 build with GCC 12 on Ubuntu 22.04 passed in my local\ntest.\n\nThis warning is raised only on GCC 12 + AArch64. I suspect it might be\nsome GCC 12 bug, so I reported it to GCC community [3].\n\nSince it involves third party code, I think it's better to suppress the\nwarning by simply disabling this warning option in the makefile.\n\nTesting: Release builds with GCC 9, GCC 11 and GCC 12 passed on Ubuntu\n22.04\/AArch64 system.\n\n[1] https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/src\/java.base\/share\/native\/libfdlibm\/k_rem_pio2.c#L290\n[2] https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/src\/java.base\/share\/native\/libfdlibm\/k_rem_pio2.c#L99\n[3] https:\/\/gcc.gnu.org\/bugzilla\/show_bug.cgi?id=106992"},"files":[{"filename":"make\/modules\/java.base\/lib\/CoreLibraries.gmk"}],"sha":"f745d060ebfe97bbbebf38503d3ddb68613ce4f0"}]
