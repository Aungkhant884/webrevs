[{"commit":{"message":"8288023: AArch64: disable PAC-RET when preview is enabled\n\nPAC-RET is not currently compatible with the continuation freeze\/thaw\nmechanism used by virtual threads, and additionally\n-XX:UseBranchProtection=pac-ret enables PreserveFramePointer which\nprevents the use of the continuation thaw fast-path (about 15% slower\nfor the \"Skynet\" JMH benchmark).  So for now just disable PAC when\n--enable-preview was also passed.\n\nSee some earlier discussion here:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/pull\/9067"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/vm_version_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"3959bbe835bc5db119c5a84411bb88415c3ea60b"}]
