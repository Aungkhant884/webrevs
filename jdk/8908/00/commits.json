[{"commit":{"message":"8287195: AArch64: Client VM build failure after JDK-8283689\n\nThe client build fails because foreignGlobals_aarch64.cpp uses Matcher\nwithout #ifdef COMPILER2.  However there's a latent bug here on SVE\nmachines where RegSpiller::pd_reg_size() returns the SVE register size\nbut other code that uses the register spill area (e.g.\nDowncallStubGenerator::generate() and AArch64Architecture.VECTOR_REG_SIZE)\nassume that we always save 16 bytes.  Since we don't support any calling\nconventions where arguments\/results are passed in long vectors we should\njust save the first 128 bits of the register, like x86 does."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/foreignGlobals_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"7c5dc9a2ae1a9bf0780d5040314edb73c529b3b2"}]
