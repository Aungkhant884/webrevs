[{"commit":{"message":"8296548: Improve MD5 intrinsic for x86_64\n\nThe LEA instruction loads the effective address, but MD5 intrinsic uses\nit for computing values than addresses. This usage potentially uses\nmore cycles than ADDs and reduces the throughput.\n\nThis change replaces\n    LEA:  r1 = r1 + rsi * 1 + t\nwith\n    ADDs: r1 += t; r1 += rsi.\n\nMicrobenchmark evaluation shows ~40% performance improvement on Haswell,\nBroadwell, Skylake, and Cascade Lake. There is ~20% improvement on 2nd\ngen Epyc.\n\nNo performance change for the same microbenchmark on Ice Lake and 3rd\ngen Epyc.\n\nSimilar results can also be observed in TestMD5Intrinsics and\nTestMD5MultiBlockIntrinsics with a more moderate improvement, e.g. ~15%\nimprovement in throughput on Haswell."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/x86\/macroAssembler_x86_md5.cpp"}],"sha":"6ed4348c5abe093318e35a0e50e4205f082dc179"}]
