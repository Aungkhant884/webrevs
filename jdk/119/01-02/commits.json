This is possible because the\n    set_obj_deopt_flag is done before the handshake.\n\n  - Don't set_suspend_equivalent() anymore for more simplicity. It's just an\n    optimization (that won't pay off here).\n\nAdded\/updated source code comments.\n\nAdditional smaller enhancements."},"files":[],"sha":"18dd54b4e6f17ca723e4ae1a1e8dc57e81878dd3"},{"commit":{"message":"8227745, 8233915: Enable Escape Analysis for Better Performance in the Presence of JVMTI Agents"},"files":[],"sha":"79f5b8234c3e2ba01b453a7c83992d5c87637206"}]
