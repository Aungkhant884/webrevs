[{"commit":{"message":"8286601: Mac Aarch: Excessive warnings to be ignored for build jdk\n\nThese warnings are ignored while building the build+full jdks with gcc,\nbut only ignored while building the full JDK if using clang. This\nproduces tons of warnings we normally ignore, e.g. unused parameter.\n\nI suggest that if we're ignoring this type of error while using gcc,\nwe should also ignore them while using clang.\n\nSigned-off-by: Adam Farley <adfarley@redhat.com>"},"files":[{"filename":"make\/autoconf\/flags-cflags.m4"}],"sha":"c1c3649dca947f498206183af0d30c1f5036cbab"}]
