[{"commit":{"message":"stubGenerator_ppc.cpp: improve code that loads vector constants\n\n  * Remove extra load of base64_48_63\n  * Instead of loading each vector constant via an initialized pointer to\n    its constant data, place all vector data in a single block constant and\n    use offsets into the block to choose which constant to load.\n    Unfortunately this method requires using fixed offsets in the table\n    which are not easy to name.  Instead I just documented in the offsets\n    in the constant block, and used them in the code.\n  * I looked at loading pairs of vectors at a time using lxvp, but due to\n    using little endian mode, the vectors get loaded in the order that is\n    opposite to order listed in the constant block.  This makes it\n    confusing to read and maintain the code, so I decided against that\n    approach."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/ppc\/stubGenerator_ppc.cpp"}],"sha":"5badbf6afb7cb0e2dfac83e771aabd4b3499cfaa"}]
