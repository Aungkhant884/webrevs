[{"commit":{"message":"8176501: Method Shape.getBounds2D() incorrectly includes Bezier control points in bounding box\n\nAddressing code review recommendation to copy javafx's optimization: we can avoid looking at the derivative and polynomial if the control points are inside our existing bounds. This involved refactoring the method getBounds2D(PathIterator) more generally. It should now be a little more efficient (and perhaps a little less readable). Since we don't have concrete performance or readability goals this is a subjective trade-off that's hard to assess."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/java\/awt\/geom\/Path2D.java"}],"sha":"e617c7229da285a00e108a62a22b997b48afe372"}]
