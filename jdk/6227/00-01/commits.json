[{"commit":{"message":"8176501: Method Shape.getBounds2D() incorrectly includes Bezier control points in bounding box\n\nAddressing some of Laurent's code review recommendations\/comments:\n\n1. use the convention t for the parametric variable x(t),y(t)\n2. solve the quadratic equation using QuadCurve2d.solveQuadratic() or like Helpers.quadraticRoots()\n3. always use braces for x = (a < b) ? ...\n4. always use double-precision constants in math or logical operations: (2 * x => 2.0 * x) and (coefficients[3] != 0) => (coefficients[3] != 0.0)\n\n(There are two additional recommendations not in this commit that I'll ask about shortly.)\n\nSee https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/pull\/6227#issuecomment-959757954"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/java\/awt\/geom\/Path2D.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/sun\/awt\/geom\/Curve.java"}],"sha":"5a0e2bd0f4ea36d877d087a1c7dd9ff1be684155"}]
