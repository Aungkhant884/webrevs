[{"commit":{"message":"8176501: Method Shape.getBounds2D() incorrectly includes Bezier control points in bounding box\n\nThe bug writeup indicated they wanted Path2D#getBounds2D() to be more accurate\/concise. They didn't explicitly say they wanted CubicCurve2D and QuadCurve2D to become more accurate too. But a preexisting unit test failed when Path2D#getBounds2D() was updated and those other classes weren't. At this point I considered either:\nA. Updating CubicCurve2D and QuadCurve2D to use the new more accurate getBounds2D() or\nB. Updating the unit test to forgive the discrepancy.\n\nI chose A. Which might technically be seen as scope creep, but it feels like a more holistic\/better approach.\n\nThis also includes a new unit test (in Path2D\/UnitTest.java) that fails without the changes in this commit."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/java\/awt\/geom\/CubicCurve2D.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/java\/awt\/geom\/Path2D.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/java\/awt\/geom\/QuadCurve2D.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/sun\/awt\/geom\/Curve.java"},{"filename":"test\/jdk\/java\/awt\/geom\/Path2D\/UnitTest.java"}],"sha":"0da9594d0c2349b24a635da23f1b81011c6139f3"}]
