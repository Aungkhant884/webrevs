[{"commit":{"message":"8176501: Method Shape.getBounds2D() incorrectly includes Bezier control points in bounding box\n\nAddressing code review recommendation to calculate polynomial coefficients using differences \/ vector notation.\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/pull\/6227#discussion_r743534560\n\nI generally understand the intention of this change, but I don't know exactly how to test\/evaluate it.\n\nThe unit tests still pass. I ran some sample calculations involving a 100x100 Ellipse2D as it was rotated, and the two getBounds2D(..) implementations (before and after this commit) only differed by a few ulps (usually around 10^-15), as expected."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/java\/awt\/geom\/Path2D.java"}],"sha":"b7ca69c85b1270af415d66db68c1c286e1e0d751"}]
