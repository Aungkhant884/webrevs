[{"commit":{"message":"8258946: Fix optimization-unstable code involving signed integer overflow\n\nOptimization-unstable code refers to code that is unexpectedly discarded\nby compiler optimizations due to undefined behavior in the program.\n\nWe applied a static checker called STACK (prototype from SOSP'13 paper\n[1]) to OpenJDK source code and found the following six sites of\npotential unstable code involving signed integer overflow.\n\nRemoving undefined behaviors would make the code stable.\n\n[1] https:\/\/css.csail.mit.edu\/stack\/"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/ifnode.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/loopTransform.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/parse2.cpp"}],"sha":"1df6f7cd172e6b3af6f7b591cdfae2fbde49a714"}]
