These pointers can be used to make linked\n-lists or binary trees or whatever. In these test cases, they are\n-used only to build singly-linked lists.\n-\n-In the main class for each ArrayJuggle test, there is an array of\n-MemoryObjects called the mainArray. This array is acted upon\n-by various threads.\n-\n-MainArrayWalker threads randomly pick a cell in the main array\n-and allocate a new MemoryObject into it. This means that\n-the previous occupant of this cell in the array and anything\n-it points to are candidates for GC.\n-\n-The CopyingThread threads copy parts of the main array into\n-a thread-local array. While it resides in the thread-local array,\n-a MemoryObject and the objects it points to should not be GC'd.\n-\n-The LinkMaker threads add new objects at the head of a linked\n-list. The head of the list is stored in the main array. These\n-links can vary in size.\n-\n-In Juggle1, a single CopyingThread copies the values of the main array to the\n-subarray, a single LinkMaker adds nodes to the main array, and a single\n-MainArrayWalker turns over the main array.\n-\n-Juggle2 is the same as Juggle1, but the CopyingThread puts a reference\n-to the main array cell in the thread-local sub-array instead of\n-copying it. A small difference.\n-\n-Juggle3 is the same as Juggle1, but is configurable for how many\n-of each type of thread exists.\n-\n-Juggle4 is the same as Juggle2, but also has arrays of threads which\n-operate on the array.\n-\n-The \"gc\" versions of these tests all have one or more threads\n-which simply sit in a loop calling System.gc() to stress the system.\n-\n-\n-These programs are designed to have their values adjusted to stress\n-different parts of the system. A simple command interface can be\n-added to adjust these at runtime, or the files can be edited and\n-recompiled.\n-\n-No attempt has been made to synchronize access to the various array\n-structures. This means that the arrays at any given moment inside\n-any given thread may not necessarily be consistent. This is by\n-design.\n-\n-Because there is no synchronization across array accesses, the\n-values given by the dumpStatistics will not be precise, but will\n-instead reflect a rolling average.\n-\n-Currently, all these programs run forever. That is because the\n-curernt 1.1E system eventually fails on these tests. Each of\n-the threads has a mechanism for stopping. The main program can\n-wait for some specified period of time or number of iterations\n-and then set runForever = false on all its child threads and\n-then join() on them and the program should eventually terminate.\n-This will be necessary for adding these to VM Testbase.\n-\n-Also, it will be interesting to run these tests in multiple\n-configurations (varying the number of mutator threads) to\n-help check for problems.\n","filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/vmTestbase\/gc\/memory\/Array\/ArrayJuggle\/ArrayJuggle.README","additions":0,"deletions":95,"binary":false,"changes":95,"status":"deleted"},{"patch":"@@ -1,23 +0,0 @@\n-#\n-# Copyright (c) 2017, 2018, Oracle and\/or its affiliates.
