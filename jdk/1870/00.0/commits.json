This prevents\nGCM from wrongly \"hoisting\" stores into descendants of their original loop. Such\nan \"inverted hoisting\" can happen due to CFGLoop::compute_freq()'s inaccurate\nestimation of frequencies for irreducible CFGs.\n\nExtend CFG verification code by checking that memory-writing nodes are placed in\neither their original loop or an ancestor.\n\nAdd tests for the reducible and irreducible cases. The former was already\nhandled correctly before the change (the frequency estimation model prevents\n\"inverted hoisting\" for reducible CFGs), and is just added for coverage.\n\nThis change addresses the specific miscompilation issue in a conservative way,\nfor simplicity and safety. Future work includes investigating if only the\nillegal blocks can be discarded as candidates for GCM hoisting, and refining\nfrequency estimation for irreducible CFGs.\n\nReviewed-by: kvn, chagedorn"},"files":[],"sha":"4e8338eb13926775513c12492b8ccb8c9a84773e"},{"commit":{"message":"8258714: Shenandoah: Process references before evacuation during degen\n\nReviewed-by: shade"},"files":[],"sha":"2525f39d35b7ce556418812613b7cc35d03c1dc6"}]
