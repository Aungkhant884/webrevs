[{"commit":{"message":"8264564: AArch64: use MOVI instead of FMOV to zero FP register\n\nHotSpot generates an FMOV from ZR to zero a floating point register:\n\n   fmov d0, xzr\n\nThis used to be recommended by the Arm ARM, but that advice was removed\nin revision A.j and subsequent revisions (section C.5.3).\n\nInteger->FP moves may be slow on some cores. Instead the preferred\ninstruction is MOVI with immediate zero:\n\n   movi d0, #0x0\n\nSome micro-architectures special-case FMOV from ZR, and on those cores\nthis change will have no effect, but in any case FMOV won't be faster\nthan MOVI.\n\nGCC made this change back in 2016:\n  https:\/\/gcc.gnu.org\/git\/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=523d72071960\n\nTested tier1 on AArch64. I don't expect this to have any visible effect\non benchmarks."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/assembler_aarch64.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/macroAssembler_aarch64.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/templateTable_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"ab5299ab2ba376eb05d3749a55b44c503f101a9b"}]
