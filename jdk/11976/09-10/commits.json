This broke some checks in the remainder of this method.\n\nI chose to restore current behaviour by comparing MANIFEST.MF and \"SIG-\" files using the full path. This saves the allocation caused by substring and also makes sure isBlockOrSF now always called with the full path."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/sun\/security\/util\/SignatureFileVerifier.java"}],"sha":"65a0a6b8d4ffd377d893a649771a9b595d265268"}]
