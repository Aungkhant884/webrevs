[{"commit":{"message":"8265891: ChannelInputStream.transferTo() uses FileChannel.transferTo()\n\nAs suggested in 8265891 this change implements a performance optimization\nfor ChannelInputStream.transferTo(): It uses FileChannel.transferTo()\nin case the wrapped channel actually is a FileChannel, as in that case,\nthe actual work of transferring bytes can potentially get offloaded to the\noperating system \/ file system.\n\nAs more such optimizations are likely to follow in the very same code\nsegment, this change is deliberately elaborate and rather complex in its\ndesign, e. g. it already holds blocking locks for the complete time of\noperation on input and output channels.\n\nSigned-off-by: Markus Karg <markus@headcrashing.eu>"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/nio\/channels\/Channels.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/sun\/nio\/ch\/ChannelInputStream.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/sun\/nio\/ch\/ChannelOutputStream.java"},{"filename":"test\/jdk\/sun\/nio\/ch\/ChannelInputStream\/TransferTo.java"}],"sha":"84a7b06cdf8b8ab2824f32d7b727436ed47840eb"}]
