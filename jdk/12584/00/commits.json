[{"commit":{"message":"8302518: Add missing Op_RoundDoubleMode in VectorNode::vector_operands()\n\nThis is a one-line fix.\n\n`VectorNode::vector_operands()` is a C2 function used to get a half-open\nrange of `[start, end)` defining which operands are vectors to process.\n`Op_RoundDoubleMode` has two operands but only the 1st one is a vector.\nIts 2nd operand is the rounding mode. Missing this op results in its 2nd\noperand treated as a vector. It is fortunate that it hasn't caused any\nissue yet as the code follows just treated the 2nd input as an immediate\nto replicate later. If we add some check like `n->is_Vector()` for the\nvectorized node then, there will be issues. We should fix this potential\nproblem.\n\nTested tier1."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/vectornode.cpp"}],"sha":"5303866122f3f58cac2d6cc348a9c48f28cd8146"}]
