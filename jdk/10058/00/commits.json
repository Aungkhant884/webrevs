[{"commit":{"message":"8288012: AArch64: unnecessary macro expansion in stubGenerator_aarch64\n\nWe use utility routines to replace macros in generate_md5_implCompress\nand generate_sha512_implCompress() functions, as these macro expanisons\nwould bloat the generator.\n\nMinor update: \"Label keys\" is removed since it's dead code.\n\nIn my local \"release + server\" build on AArch64 machine, the size of\nstubGenerator_aarch64.o is reduced about 9% (from 6.73 MB to 6.13 MB).\n\nTestings:\nTier1~3 passed on sha512 feature supporting machine.\nWe evaluted JMH test case MessageDigests.java and didn't see viable\nperformance change with and without this patch."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/stubGenerator_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"e606d2eca6327ab52a87867eafb8ef0f32bd185c"}]
