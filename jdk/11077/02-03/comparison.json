This option can by enabled by passing <code>--enable-conforming-compilation<\/code> during configure, but is off by default. If you just want to compile a working JDK it is not recommended that you set this flag, as it is mainly meant to aid developers that are working with native code.<\/p>\n","filename":"doc\/building.html","additions":0,"deletions":3,"binary":false,"changes":3,"status":"modified"}]}
