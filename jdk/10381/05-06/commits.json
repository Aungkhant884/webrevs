[{"commit":{"message":"Add a unit test verifying a change in reported error for final variables.\n\nBefore this change, compiling this class:\n\n    class LambdaMutateFinalVar {\n        LambdaMutateFinalVar() {\n            final String x;\n            Runnable r1 = () -> x = \"not ok\";\n            x = \"ok\";\n        }\n    }\n\nwould report this error:\n\n  local variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final\n\nThat error is not really appropriate; after all, the variable IS final. The\nreal problem is that it can't be assigned from within the lambda because it\ncan't be assumed to be DU.\n\nAfter this change, this error is reported instead:\n\n  variable x might already have been assigned"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/langtools\/tools\/javac\/lambda\/8043179\/LambdaMutateFinalVar.java"},{"filename":"test\/langtools\/tools\/javac\/lambda\/8043179\/LambdaMutateFinalVar.out"}],"sha":"9352f989e9ed5816635a86dc055330b64eef6150"}]
