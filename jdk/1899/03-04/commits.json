[{"commit":{"message":"8258961: move some fields of SafePointNode from public to protected\n\nrevert code change to devirtualize Node::jvms().\nThere are 3 nodes override jvms() --  SafePointNode, MachSafePointNode and\nMachHalt. It does not make sense to devirtualize it because we have to do\nnon-trivial dispatch based on types in Node::jvms(). It is not worth it."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/machnode.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/node.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/node.hpp"}],"sha":"cdac2d764e26a996a4f5e8f54980117780e25631"}]
