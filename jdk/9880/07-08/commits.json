[{"commit":{"message":"Replace _unlimited_memory with calls to os::Linux\n\n_unlimited_memory was a constant in cgroupV1Subsystem_linux which is\ninitialised to a very large number and used as a ceiling sanity check\nwhen reading a number of memory-related cgroup limits. This was not\nsufficient to rule out all possible bad values from cgroups and so a\nlower ceiling, set to the host's physical RAM, was needed (8292083)\n\nEliminate _unlimited_memory which is superfluous and use the host\nphysical memory instead.\n\nFor memory_and_swap_limit_in_bytes we need a higher limit than\nphysical RAM, so extend os::Linux to report on the host's configured\nswap value and combine the two."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/os\/linux\/cgroupV1Subsystem_linux.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/os\/linux\/cgroupV1Subsystem_linux.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/os\/linux\/os_linux.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/os\/linux\/os_linux.hpp"}],"sha":"66bb149da64198368c42fc6b51643fd2e0271f4b"}]
