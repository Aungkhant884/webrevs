Since we control notation length we\r\n        can bypass some controls,\r\n        directly generate the color value,\r\n        without generate a new string,\r\n        and reject a wrong number format without generate any exception."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/javax\/swing\/text\/html\/CSS.java"}],"sha":"8f65b852b7d93084792ed8ce7a5cd03c23aac012"}]
