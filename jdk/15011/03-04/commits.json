All jtreg cases in this folder\nare invoked by test driver `VectorizationTestRunner.java` which checks\nboth correctness and vectorizability (IR) for each test method. We added\nflagless requirement before because extra flags may mess with compiler\ncontrol in the test driver for correctness check. But `flagless` has a\nside effect that it makes tests with extra flags skipped. So we propose\nto get rid of it now.\n\nTo adapt the removal of `@require vm.flagless`, a few checks are added\nin the test driver to skip the correctness check if extra flags make the\ncompiler control not work. This patch also moves previously hard-coded\nflag `-XX:-OptimizeFill` in the test driver to conditions in IR checks.\n\nTested various of compiler control related VM flags on x86 and AArch64."},"files":[],"sha":"014d75111b53f52217e877f7da3a905cc2710ff1"}]
