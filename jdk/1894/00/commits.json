[{"commit":{"message":"8258857: Zero: non-PCH build fails after JDK-8258074\n\nFrom the error log we can see the root cause is that, develop_pd flag\n'pd_CICompileOSR' is undeclared in zero build.\n\nWhere this flag is used?\nFlag 'pd_CICompileOSR' is assigned to flag 'CICompileOSR'. See line 77\nof 'compiler_globals.hpp' and further line 86 of 'globals_shared.hpp'.\n\nWhere this flag can be declared?\nHeader files 'c1_globals.hpp' or 'c2_globals.hpp' would be included if\nVM is built with compiler1 or compiler2. See lines 30 to 38 of\n'complier_globals.hpp'. And further, flag 'pd_CICompileOSR' may get\ndeclared in the header files for specific arch, e.g.,\n'c1_globals_aarch64.hpp', 'c2_globals_aarch64.hpp'.\nHowever, regarding zero build (without compiler1 and compiler2 and\njvmci) , this flag is undelcared. Hence, this patch gets header file\n'compiler\/compiler_globals_pd.hpp' included where this flag is declared\nfor the case when neither COMPILER1 nor COMPILER2 are defined and\nINCLUDE_JVMCI is inactive.\n\nNote that 'compiler\/compiler_globals_pd.hpp' already includes\n'runtime\/globals_shared.hpp'.\n\nNote that zero build with PCH succeeds because 'runtime\/globals.hpp' is\nincluded in 'precompiled.hpp', and further 'compiler_globals_pd.hpp' is\nincluded in 'runtime\/globals.hpp'."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/compiler\/compiler_globals.hpp"}],"sha":"0cc564bd320f959cfd3affb41c01beb29033ec06"}]
