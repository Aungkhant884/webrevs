[{"commit":{"message":"8285630: Fix a configure error in RISC-V cross build\n\nWe are trying to cross build a RISC-V version of OpenJDK. We specified\n`--openjdk-target=riscv64-linux-gnu` after `bash configure` but got an\nerror message.\n\n```\nconfigure: error: \/usr\/bin\/bash \/home\/ent-user\/jdk_src\/make\/autoconf\/build-aux\/config.sub riscv64-linux-gnu failed\nconfigure exiting with result code 1\n```\n\nIt shows the processing of `riscv64-linux-gnu` in script `config.sub`\nfails. We see `config.sub` calls another script `autoconf-config.sub`\nto validate and canonicalize a configuration type. The validation fails\nhere because `autoconf-config.sub` is a quite old version and has no\nRISC-V support inside. Comments in those scripts tell us patching the\nautoconf script is not a good idea so we add a fix in `config.sub` in\nthis patch.\n\nWe have verified RISC-V cross build succeeds after this change. As we\nare not quite familiar with the build system, please let us know if this\nis the best way to fix."},"files":[{"filename":"make\/autoconf\/build-aux\/config.sub"}],"sha":"3d03e6d7c9cdef323f196f134140bc3addabc74d"}]
