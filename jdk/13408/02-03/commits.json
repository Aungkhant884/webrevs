[{"commit":{"message":"4200096: rewrite solution, only print stacktrace if theConsumer != null\n\nI don't like that we're *expecting* a NullPointerException to get thrown in the course of an allowed use case, but that's probably just a preferences on my part. More importantly: this branch passes all new unit tests.
