[{"commit":{"message":"8256657: Add cross-compiled build for Windows+Arm64 to submit workflow\n\nThis adds the cross-compiled build only, as no Windows+Arm64 machines are available on GitHub Action that we could use to run the tests.\n\nDue to cross-compilation a build JDK is required. Initially I added EA builds to be downloaded from https:\/\/jdk.java.net\/16\/ and used for that, but then I saw how @shipiliv attempted it for the linux cross-compilation builds in https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/pull\/1147.  That is using the JDK image produced by the x64 variant. This however add more stress to the \"critical path\", as now two more jobs depend on the x64 build first.\n\nLet's see how it works out in the long-run. A Windows+AArch64 build takes 40-50min."},"files":[{"filename":".github\/workflows\/submit.yml"}],"sha":"e3694ad7388452b84eae1a973a55033c51eaff99"}]
