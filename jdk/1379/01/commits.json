Initially I added EA builds to be downloaded from https:\/\/jdk.java.net\/16\/ and used for that, but then I saw how @shipiliv attempted it for the linux cross-compilation builds in https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/pull\/1147.  That is using the JDK image produced by the x64 variant. This however add more stress to the \"critical path\", as now two more jobs depend on the x64 build first.\n\nLet's see how it works out in the long-run. A Windows+AArch64 build takes 40-50min."},"files":[{"filename":".github\/workflows\/submit.yml"}],"sha":"e3694ad7388452b84eae1a973a55033c51eaff99"}]
