[{"commit":{"message":"Fix Jtreg failures on NEON with -XX:MaxVectorSize=8\n\n[Byte|Short|Int|Long|Float|Double]128VectorTests.java failed on NEON\nplatform with -XX:MaxVectorSize=8.\n\nThe root cause lies in that 128-bit vector MulReduction operations would\npass the check in match_rule_supported_vector(), i.e. returning true if\nlengh_in_bytes is 16, which should be invalid since MaxVectorSize=8.\n\nIn this patch, we improve the check logic a bit, i.e. failing fast if\nthe conditions are not satisfied and falling through to check\nvector_size_supported() eventually.\n\nSimilar update is done to the check for Op_MulAddVS2VI."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_vector.ad"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64_vector_ad.m4"}],"sha":"8789921431b63f60dbcc832f81273336e3834ec6"}]
