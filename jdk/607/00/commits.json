[{"commit":{"message":"8252407: Build failure with gcc-8+ and asan.\n\nSummary: Fix stringop-truncation warnings casused by gcc.\n\nThe newer gcc(gcc-8 or higher) would warn for calls to bounded string\nmanipulation functions such as 'strncpy' that may either truncate the\ncopied string or leave the destination unchanged.\n\nThe reason is that -fsanitize=address might simply incompatible with\n-Wstringop-truncation. This patch disables stringop-truncation warning\nwhen asan enabled, also disables the defining of _FORTIFY_SOURCE in\nfastdebug builds for some potential risks.\n\nChange-Id: I45a4e7f94620381809ebdd2f68b32acf836fd068"},"files":[{"filename":"make\/autoconf\/flags-cflags.m4"},{"filename":"make\/autoconf\/jdk-options.m4"}],"sha":"e5cec6eea949b05d7651676842b05d04774aa5de"}]
