If the probe request does not have request params, the\nrequest is invalid and a test assertion fails. This commit replaces that\nassertion with returning a 400 response."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/jdk\/java\/net\/httpclient\/ShortResponseBody.java"}],"sha":"f8a56d1f03dd461611131551f4f03b974b31b118"}]
