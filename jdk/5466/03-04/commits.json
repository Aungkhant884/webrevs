[{"commit":{"message":"The biggest problem i have is that the new logic reverts the mechanic of the selection mode of the table - when no selection mode set it announces the content of all the cells in the current row and when either row or column selection mode is set it only announces the content of a single cell. Also when only cell selection is allowed it announces row as dimmed which is strange."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/macosx\/native\/libawt_lwawt\/awt\/a11y\/TableAccessibility.m"}],"sha":"248e2c641fdaa21aa9c62fa1fd411d8ef65d8642"}]
