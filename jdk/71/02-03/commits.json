[{"commit":{"message":"8173585: Intrinsify StringLatin1.indexOf(char)\n\nRewrite of unit test and newlines added to end of files\n\nChanges to unit test:\n- main test adjusted such that Strings gennerated are much longer (up to\n2048 characters) and of the form: azaza, aazaazaa, aaazaaazaaa, etc with\n'z' being the search character searched for. Multiple instances of the\nsearch character are included in the String in order to validate that\nthe starting offset is correctly handleded. Results are compared to non\nintrinsified version of the code. Longer strings means that the looping\nfunctionality of the various paths is entered into.\n- Run configurations introduced such that it checks behaviour where use\nof SSE and AVX instructions are restricted.\n- Tier4InvocationThreshold adjusted so as to ensure C2 code iis invoked.\n\nOther changes:\n- newlines added at end of files"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/x86\/c2_MacroAssembler_x86.cpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/intrinsics\/string\/TestStringLatin1IndexOfChar.java"},{"filename":"test\/micro\/org\/openjdk\/bench\/java\/lang\/StringIndexOfChar.java"}],"sha":"c8a2849ea96e970186182d6ae9bbd86c99f86382"}]
