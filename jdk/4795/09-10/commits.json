[{"commit":{"message":"Add @summary to tests\n\nFrom https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/faq.html:\n\nThe @summary tag describes the condition that is checked by the test. It is especially useful for non-regression tests, which by definition don't have bug numbers, but even if there's a bug number it's helpful to include a summary. Note that a test summary is generally not the same thing as a Bugtraq synopsis, since the latter describes the bug rather than the condition that the bug violates.\n\nThat said, the JBS synopsis for 8266666 suits those tests just fine."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/langtools\/jdk\/javadoc\/doclet\/testSnippetTag\/TestSnippetTag.java"},{"filename":"test\/langtools\/tools\/javac\/doctree\/SnippetTest.java"}],"sha":"0510287efed2d8af6e33b9581b1c02dcee1fced4"}]
