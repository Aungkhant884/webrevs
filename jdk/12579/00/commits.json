[{"commit":{"message":"8292914: Drop the counter from lambda class names\n\nThe class generated for lambda proxies is now defined as a hidden class. This means that the counter, which was used to ensure a unique class name and avoid clashes, is now redundant. In addition to performing redundant work, this also impacts build reproducibility for native image generators which might already have a strategy to cope with hidden classes but cannot cope with indeterminate definition order for lambda proxy classes."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/lang\/invoke\/InnerClassLambdaMetafactory.java"}],"sha":"5ab516a5bbc0770360e6e9c77ed4e301cd43be5f"}]
