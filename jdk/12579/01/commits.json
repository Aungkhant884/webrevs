[{"commit":{"message":"8292914: Drop the counter from lambda class names\n\nThe class generated for lambda proxies is now defined as a hidden class. This means that the counter, which was used to ensure a unique class name and avoid clashes, is now redundant. In addition to performing redundant work, this also impacts build reproducibility for native image generators which might already have a strategy to cope with hidden classes but cannot cope with indeterminate definition order for lambda proxy classes.\n\nAdditionally, the lambda proxy class dumper is enhanced to prepend a raw timestamp before the filename."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/lang\/invoke\/InnerClassLambdaMetafactory.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/lang\/invoke\/ProxyClassesDumper.java"}],"sha":"0e109beb512b30fb4449ded067f010ea3284dbe9"}]
