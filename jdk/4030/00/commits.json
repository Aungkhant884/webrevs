[{"commit":{"message":"AArch64: Improve C1 Stub Frame code\n\nFor many of the stub frames, a leave\/ret is generated after the stub has\nalready branched or returned. This is confusing. For these cases, replace\nthe superfluous code with a should_not_reach_here\n\nFor handle excception, instead of storing return from the exception\nhandler on the stack, it can be moved directly into lr, replacing a store and\nload with a single move. (If\/when PAC support is implemented, then this store\nwould also have to be signed)."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/c1_Runtime1_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"6f060c593a348150c97aa1108edd7414e4af04ea"}]
