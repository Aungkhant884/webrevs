[{"commit":{"message":"Remove three asserts making comparisons between atomic volatile variables\n\nThough changes to the volatile variables are individually protected by\nAtomic load and store operations, these asserts were not assuring\natomic access to multiple volatile variables, each of which could be\nmodified independently of the others.  The asserts were therefore not\ntrustworthy, as has been confirmed by more extensive testing."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahGeneration.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahHeapRegion.inline.hpp"}],"sha":"8d80780a64d7058bffa27b269157596d937a6b22"}]
