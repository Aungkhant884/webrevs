Such alignment might also happen in the non-generational case, but\nin this case the specific size used in the test was affected on machines\nwith larger than usual os page size settings.\n\nThe alignment related adjustment would have affected all generational\ncollectors (except perhaps Gen Z). In the future, we might try and relax\nthis alignment constraint.alignment."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/gc\/shenandoah\/oom\/TestAllocOutOfMemory.java"}],"sha":"88958669d3f6c60bb6d115cc4e345f7ac1a2686e"}]
