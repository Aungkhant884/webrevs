[{"commit":{"message":"8262726: AArch64: C1 StubAssembler::call_RT can corrupt stack\n\nStubAssembler::call_RT() has some code to shuffle arguments using the\nstack as temporary storage. But there's a typo: the first pre(sp, 2 *\nwordSize) should be pre(sp, -2 * wordSize) otherwise the pushes and pops\nare unbalanced.\n\nI think this was exposed by JDK-8259619 which fixed the conflict check\nbut AFAIK it only causes a problem on the Valhalla lworld branch and is\nnot used otherwise.\n\nI would rather replace this code with an assert that the conflict never\noccurs as we are in full control of the argument registers passed to\ncall_RT (the PPC port does this, for example)."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/c1_Runtime1_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"80d3fbbb03c11a0220d344307228bf18706e4dd5"}]
