The tier2 completion usually waits on it. Profiling shows we are spending time during classloading, checking dependencies. Since we load lots of classes, we do it many times, and each time the cost grows linearly to the number of classes. Some other tests that target metaspace explicitly disable `VerifyDependencies` to avoid this.\n\nThe commit includes adding \"-XX:-VerifyDependencies\" along with \"-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions\" in TestJmapCore.java to make sure that release builds work with the test, as VerifyDependencies is a develop option and not available in release builds. The changes in the commit is resulting in considerable improvement for the test in fastdebug mode as can be seen below:\n\n* before: **130.41s user 14.11s system 118% cpu 2:01.85 total**\n* after: **27.52s user 13.64s system 213% cpu 19.249 total**"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/serviceability\/sa\/TestJmapCore.java"}],"sha":"fe46bdbf94724fc7658996223b465d37b9e41827"}]
