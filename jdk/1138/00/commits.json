[{"commit":{"message":"8256025: AArch64: MachCallRuntimeNode::ret_addr_offset() is incorrect for stub calls\n\nThe PR for JDK-8254231 introduces a new assertion in opto\/output.cpp to\ncheck the current instruction offset against the offset of the call\nreturn address reported by ret_addr_offset(). This fails on AArch64\nbecause MachCallRuntimeNode::ret_addr_offset() claims four instructions\nare generated for a stub call (far branch) but actually it's just\none (blr to stub or trampoline).\n\nTested jtreg hotspot_all_no_apps, jdk_core."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64.ad"}],"sha":"1570be1e27898168736eb479c85153d9d1dfec4e"}]
