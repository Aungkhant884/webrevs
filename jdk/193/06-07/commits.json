[{"commit":{"message":"Move the check work to java, restore code in VM. Modified test code according to the changes. The invoke name verififcation is not implemented since not all the holder class are processed, not all the functions of processed holder classes are added. For holder class with DirectMethodHandle in its name, only the name in the DMH_METHOD_TYPE_MAP keyset is added, ithe line with other names just gets skipped silently. This makes the verification on invoke names difficul, a name not in the keyset should not fail the test. Also add a boolean to cdsGenerateHolderClasses to indicate call path."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/classfile\/lambdaFormInvokers.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/lang\/invoke\/GenerateJLIClassesHelper.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/lang\/invoke\/MethodHandleImpl.java"}],"sha":"125112b3e0dd1298ab9d8b24ffcda0bb1170b7a3"}]
