[{"commit":{"message":"8258894: C2: Forbid GCM to move stores into loops\n\nPrevent GCM from placing memory-writing nodes (such as stores) into loops deeper\nthan their home loop (determined by their control input). Such placements are\ninvalid, as they cause memory definitions to interfere, and risk causing\nmiscompilations. This change complements JDK-8255763, which only addresses\ninvalid placements in irreducible CFGs.\n\nAdd control input to stores in generated stubs to ensure that all memory-writing\nnodes have control inputs from which their home block can be derived.\n\nAdd a battery of simplified fuzzer test cases where, before this change, GCM\nmoves stores into deeper loops."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/block.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/block.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/gcm.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/generateOptoStub.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/node.hpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/codegen\/TestGCMStorePlacement.java"}],"sha":"132f7582e4bff6602b61ebf638b284c89d5adbf6"}]
