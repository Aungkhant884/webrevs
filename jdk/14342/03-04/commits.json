[{"commit":{"message":"More changes from review:\n\nI didn't like the name of the helper method 'checkForCommit' because it\ndoesn't indicate that it might commit the event.  I also don't like\n'commitEvent' because it might not.  Since JFR events are sort of like a\nqueue I went with a name from collections and called it 'offer' so using\nit is something like 'SocketReadEvent.offer(...)' which seems like it\ngets the idea across better.  Also improved the javadoc for it.\n\nRemoved the comments about being instrumented by JFR in\nSocket.SocketInputStream and Socket.SocketOutputStream.\n\nI went ahead and moved the event commiting out of the finally block so\nthat we don't emit events when the read\/write did not actually happen.\nThe bugid JDK-8310979 will be used to determine if more should be done\nin this area.\n\nThe implRead and implWrite were moved up with the other support methods\nfor read\/write."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/net\/Socket.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/jdk\/internal\/event\/SocketReadEvent.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/jdk\/internal\/event\/SocketWriteEvent.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/sun\/nio\/ch\/SocketChannelImpl.java"},{"filename":"test\/micro\/org\/openjdk\/bench\/java\/net\/SocketEventOverhead.java"}],"sha":"9fa2745960aea0bc45642081bac89fb5ef65809e"}]
