ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n-        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n-\n-    1. DEFINITIONS\n-\n-    \"Contribution\" means:\n-\n-      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n-         Distributed under this Agreement, and\n-\n-      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: \n-         i) changes to the Program, and \n-         ii) additions to the Program;\n-      where such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from\n-      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n-      \"originates\" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n-      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n-      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\n-      are not Modified Works.\n-\n-    \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n-\n-    \"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n-    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n-    or when combined with the Program.\n-\n-    \"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\n-    Agreement.\n-\n-    \"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\n-    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n-\n-    \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\n-    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\n-    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n-    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n-\n-    \"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\n-    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\n-    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\n-    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\n-    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,\n-    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\n-    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\n-    or Modified Works thereof.\n-\n-    \"Distribute\" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\n-    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n-\n-    \"Source Code\" means the form of a Program preferred for making\n-    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,\n-    documentation source, and configuration files.\n-\n-    \"Secondary License\" means either the GNU General Public License,\n-    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\n-    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\n-    Contributor.\n-\n-    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n-\n-      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n-      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n-      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n-      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n-      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n-\n-      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n-      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n-      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n-      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n-      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n-      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n-      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n-      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n-      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n-      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n-      licensed hereunder.\n-\n-      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n-      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n-      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n-      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n-      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n-      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n-      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n-      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n-      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n-      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n-      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n-      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-      before distributing the Program.\n-\n-      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n-      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n-      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n-      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n-      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n-      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n-      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n-\n-    3. REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n-\n-      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n-      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n-      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n-      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n-      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n-      used for software exchange; and\n-\n-      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n-      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n-         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n-         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n-         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n-         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n-         for a particular purpose;\n-\n-         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n-         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n-         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n-\n-         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n-         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n-\n-         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n-         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n-         of this section 3.\n-\n-    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n-\n-      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n-      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n-      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n-      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n-      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n-      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n-\n-      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n-      the Program.\n-\n-    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\n-    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n-    of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\n-    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\n-    their own appropriate notices.\n-\n-    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n-    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n-    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n-    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n-    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n-    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n-    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n-    (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n-    other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n-    damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n-    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n-    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n-    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n-    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n-    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n-    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n-    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n-    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n-    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n-    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n-    participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n-\n-    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n-    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n-    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n-    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n-    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n-    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n-    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\n-    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n-    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\n-    those damages.\n-\n-    5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n-    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n-    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n-    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n-    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\n-    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n-    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n-    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\n-    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n-\n-    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-\n-    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n-    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n-    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n-    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n-    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n-    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n-    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n-    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n-    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-    7. GENERAL\n-\n-    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n-    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n-    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n-    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n-    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n-\n-    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n-    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n-    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\n-    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n-    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n-    litigation is filed.\n-\n-    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n-    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n-    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\n-    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\n-    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\n-    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n-    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\n-    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n-\n-    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n-    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\n-    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\n-    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\n-    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n-    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\n-    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\n-    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\n-    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\n-    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\n-    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\n-    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\n-    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\n-    Contributions) under the new version.\n-\n-    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\n-    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\n-    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n-    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n-    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\n-    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\n-    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n-\n-    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n-\n-    \"This Source Code may also be made available under the following \n-    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth \n-    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\n-    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n-\n-      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n-      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n-\n-      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n-      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n-      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n-      look for such a notice.\n-\n-      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n-\n----\n-\n-##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n-\n-    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\n-    Boston, MA 02110-1335\n-    USA\n-\n-    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n-    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n-\n-    Preamble\n-\n-    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\n-    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n-    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n-    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n-    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n-    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n-    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n-    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n-\n-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n-    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n-    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n-    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n-    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n-    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n-    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n-    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n-    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n-    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n-    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-    distribute and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-    authors' reputations.\n-\n-    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n-    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n-    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n-    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-    modification follow.\n-\n-    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n-    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n-    the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\n-    to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\n-    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n-    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n-    verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n-    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n-    \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n-    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n-    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n-    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n-    is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n-    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n-    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n-    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n-    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n-    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n-    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n-    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n-    that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n-        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n-        under the terms of this License.\n-\n-        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n-        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n-        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n-        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n-        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n-        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n-        is not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n-    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n-    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n-    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n-    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n-    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-    collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n-    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n-    scope of this License.\n-\n-    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n-        of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-        customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n-        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n-        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n-        accord with Subsection b above.)\n-\n-    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n-    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n-    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n-    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n-    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n-    executable.\n-\n-    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n-    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n-    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n-    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n-    along with the object code.\n-\n-    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n-    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n-    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n-    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n-    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n-    full compliance.\n-\n-    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n-    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n-    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n-    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n-    Program or works based on it.\n-\n-    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n-    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\n-    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n-\n-    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\n-    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n-    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n-    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n-    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n-    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n-    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n-    distribution of the Program.\n-\n-    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-    circumstances.\n-\n-    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n-    by public license practices. Many people have made generous\n-    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\n-    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\n-    the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n-    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n-\n-    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n-    a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-    8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n-    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n-    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n-    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n-    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n-    limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n-\n-    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n-    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n-    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n-    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n-    later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n-    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n-    Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n-    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n-    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n-    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n-    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n-    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n-    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-    NO WARRANTY\n-\n-    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n-    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n-    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\n-    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\n-    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n-    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-    AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\n-    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n-    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n-    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n-    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\n-    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\n-    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n-    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\n-    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\n-    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-    \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-        Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n-        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n-        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n-        (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n-        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n-        General Public License for more details.\n-\n-        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n-        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n-        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n-\n-    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n-    when it starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n-        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n-        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\n-        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n-\n-    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\n-    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\n-    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\n-    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n-    school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n-    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n-\n-        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n-        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by\n-        James Hacker.\n-\n-        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n-        Ty Coon, President of Vice\n-\n-    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n-    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\n-    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\n-    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\n-    General Public License instead of this License.\n-\n----\n-\n-## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION\n-\n-    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\n-    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\n-    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\n-    combination.\n-\n-    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n-    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n-    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\n-    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\n-    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\n-    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\n-    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\n-    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\n-    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\n-    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement\n-    from your version.\n-\n-Notice File :\n-# Notices for Jakarta Mail\n-\n-This content is produced and maintained by the Jakarta Mail project.\n-\n-* Project home: https:\/\/projects.eclipse.org\/projects\/ee4j.mail\n-\n-## Trademarks\n-\n-Jakarta Mail is a trademark of the Eclipse Foundation.\n-\n-## Copyright\n-\n-All content is the property of the respective authors or their employers.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n+    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n+\n+1. DEFINITIONS\n+\n+\"Contribution\" means:\n+\n+  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n+     Distributed under this Agreement, and\n+\n+  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: \n+     i) changes to the Program, and \n+     ii) additions to the Program;\n+  where such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from\n+  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n+  \"originates\" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n+  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n+  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\n+  are not Modified Works.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n+are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n+or when combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\n+Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\n+or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n+\n+\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\n+form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\n+editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n+represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n+\n+\"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\n+results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\n+contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\n+in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\n+Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,\n+interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\n+in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\n+or Modified Works thereof.\n+\n+\"Distribute\" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\n+in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n+\n+\"Source Code\" means the form of a Program preferred for making\n+modifications, including but not limited to software source code,\n+documentation source, and configuration files.\n+\n+\"Secondary License\" means either the GNU General Public License,\n+Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\n+exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\n+Contributor.\n+\n+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+\n+  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n+  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n+  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n+  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n+  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n+\n+  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n+  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n+  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n+  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n+  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n+  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n+  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n+  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n+  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n+  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n+  licensed hereunder.\n+\n+  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n+  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n+  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n+  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n+  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n+  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n+  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n+  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n+  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n+  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n+  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n+  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+  before distributing the Program.\n+\n+  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n+  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n+  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n+  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n+  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n+  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n+  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n+\n+3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n+\n+  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n+  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n+  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n+  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n+  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n+  used for software exchange; and\n+\n+  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n+  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n+     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n+     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n+     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n+     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n+     for a particular purpose;\n+\n+     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n+     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n+     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n+\n+     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n+     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n+\n+     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n+     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n+     of this section 3.\n+\n+3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n+\n+  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n+  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n+  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n+  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n+  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n+  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n+\n+  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n+  the Program.\n+\n+3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\n+trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n+of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\n+the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\n+their own appropriate notices.\n+\n+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n+with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n+license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n+the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n+offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n+liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n+the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n+(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n+other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n+damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n+and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n+Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n+Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n+in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n+apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n+intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n+Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n+writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n+and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n+related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n+participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n+product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n+Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n+claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n+claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n+alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n+defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\n+claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n+pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\n+those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n+PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n+BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n+TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n+appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\n+risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n+including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n+compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\n+or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n+PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n+SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n+EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n+PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n+CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n+ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n+EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n+applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n+the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n+action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n+minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n+Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\n+or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n+rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n+litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n+fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n+Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\n+time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\n+rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\n+and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n+However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\n+granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n+but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\n+may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\n+reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\n+this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n+Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\n+is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\n+responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\n+entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\n+version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\n+Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\n+received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\n+Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\n+Contributions) under the new version.\n+\n+Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\n+receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\n+Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n+estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n+under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\n+to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\n+No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n+\n+Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n+\n+\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following \n+Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth \n+in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\n+version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n+\n+  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n+  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n+\n+  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n+  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n+  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n+  look for such a notice.\n+\n+  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n+\n+=================================================\n+The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n+=================================================\n+Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n+51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\n+Boston, MA 02110-1335\n+USA\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n+of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n+\n+Preamble\n+\n+The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\n+share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n+intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n+make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n+License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n+to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n+Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n+Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n+\n+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n+Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n+freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n+service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n+free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n+to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n+restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n+\n+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n+You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n+And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n+distribute and\/or modify the software.\n+\n+Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n+software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n+authors' reputations.\n+\n+Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n+We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n+individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n+proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n+be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n+\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\n+TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+\n+0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n+notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n+the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\n+to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\n+either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n+to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n+verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n+(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n+\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n+\n+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n+the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n+covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n+(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n+is true depends on what the Program does.\n+\n+1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n+code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n+and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n+and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n+this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n+recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n+\n+2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n+it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n+such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n+that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n+\n+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n+    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n+    under the terms of this License.\n+\n+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n+    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n+    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n+    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n+    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n+    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n+    is not required to print an announcement.)\n+\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n+can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n+the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n+License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n+whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n+\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n+collective works based on the Program.\n+\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n+storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n+scope of this License.\n+\n+3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n+\n+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n+    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n+    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n+    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n+    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n+    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n+    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n+    accord with Subsection b above.)\n+\n+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n+means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n+compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n+exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n+executable.\n+\n+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n+to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n+the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n+code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n+along with the object code.\n+\n+4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n+except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n+to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n+automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n+who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n+not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n+full compliance.\n+\n+5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n+signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n+distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n+its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n+Program or works based on it.\n+\n+6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n+these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n+on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\n+responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n+\n+7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\n+so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n+any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n+distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n+not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n+receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n+could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n+distribution of the Program.\n+\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n+circumstances.\n+\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n+by public license practices. Many people have made generous\n+contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\n+system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\n+the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n+software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n+\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n+a consequence of the rest of this License.\n+\n+8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n+add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n+countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n+not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n+limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n+\n+9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n+versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n+versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n+differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n+later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n+the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n+number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n+Free Software Foundation.\n+\n+10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n+author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n+Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n+sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n+two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n+software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n+\n+NO WARRANTY\n+\n+11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n+WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n+EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n+WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\n+ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\n+YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n+NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n+AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\n+DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n+DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n+(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n+INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\n+THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\n+OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n+\n+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n+\n+To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\n+attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\n+the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n+\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n+    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n+    (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n+    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n+    General Public License for more details.\n+\n+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n+    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n+    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n+\n+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n+\n+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n+when it starts in an interactive mode:\n+\n+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n+    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\n+    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n+\n+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\n+appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\n+you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\n+could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n+\n+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n+school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n+necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n+\n+    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n+    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by\n+    James Hacker.\n+\n+    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n+    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n+\n+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n+into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\n+may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\n+with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\n+General Public License instead of this License.\n+\n+================================\n+CLASSPATH EXCEPTION\n+===============================\n+Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\n+making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\n+conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\n+combination.\n+\n+As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n+permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n+executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\n+modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\n+terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\n+independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\n+module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\n+based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\n+exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\n+do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement\n+from your version.\n+\n+==========================\n+Notice.md\n+==========================\n+Notices for Jakarta Mail\n+\n+This content is produced and maintained by the Jakarta Mail project.\n+\n+    Project home: https:\/\/projects.eclipse.org\/projects\/ee4j.mail\n+\n+Trademarks\n+\n+Jakarta Mail is a trademark of the Eclipse Foundation.\n+Copyright\n+\n+All content is the property of the respective authors or their employers.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n+    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n+\n+1. DEFINITIONS\n+\n+\"Contribution\" means:\n+\n+  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n+     Distributed under this Agreement, and\n+\n+  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: \n+     i) changes to the Program, and \n+     ii) additions to the Program;\n+  where such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from\n+  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n+  \"originates\" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n+  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n+  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\n+  are not Modified Works.\n+\n+\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n+\n+\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n+are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n+or when combined with the Program.\n+\n+\"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\n+Agreement.\n+\n+\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\n+or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n+\n+\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\n+form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\n+editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n+represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n+\n+\"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\n+results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\n+contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\n+in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\n+Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,\n+interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\n+in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\n+or Modified Works thereof.\n+\n+\"Distribute\" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\n+in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n+\n+\"Source Code\" means the form of a Program preferred for making\n+modifications, including but not limited to software source code,\n+documentation source, and configuration files.\n+\n+\"Secondary License\" means either the GNU General Public License,\n+Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\n+exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\n+Contributor.\n+\n+2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+\n+  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n+  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n+  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n+  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n+  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n+\n+  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n+  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n+  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n+  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n+  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n+  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n+  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n+  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n+  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n+  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n+  licensed hereunder.\n+\n+  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n+  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n+  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n+  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n+  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n+  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n+  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n+  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n+  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n+  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n+  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n+  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+  before distributing the Program.\n+\n+  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n+  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n+  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n+  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n+  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n+  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n+  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n+\n+3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n+\n+  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n+  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n+  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n+  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n+  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n+  used for software exchange; and\n+\n+  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n+  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n+     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n+     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n+     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n+     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n+     for a particular purpose;\n+\n+     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n+     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n+     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n+\n+     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n+     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n+\n+     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n+     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n+     of this section 3.\n+\n+3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n+\n+  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n+  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n+  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n+  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n+  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n+  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n+\n+  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n+  the Program.\n+\n+3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\n+trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n+of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\n+the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\n+their own appropriate notices.\n+\n+4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n+with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n+license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n+the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n+offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n+liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n+the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n+(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n+other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n+damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n+and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n+Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n+Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n+in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n+apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n+intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n+Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n+writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n+and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n+related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n+participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n+\n+For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n+product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n+Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n+claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n+claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n+alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n+defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\n+claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n+pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\n+those damages.\n+\n+5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n+PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n+BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n+TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n+appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\n+risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n+including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n+compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\n+or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n+\n+6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n+PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n+SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n+EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n+PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n+CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n+ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n+EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+7. GENERAL\n+\n+If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n+applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n+the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n+action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n+minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n+Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\n+or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n+rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n+litigation is filed.\n+\n+All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n+fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n+Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\n+time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\n+rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\n+and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n+However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\n+granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n+but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\n+may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\n+reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\n+this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n+Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\n+is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\n+responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\n+entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\n+version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\n+Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\n+received.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n+intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n+make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n+License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n+to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n+Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n+Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n+\n+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n+Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n+freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n+service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n+free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n+to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n+restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n+\n+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n+You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n+And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n+distribute and\/or modify the software.\n+\n+Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n+software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n+authors' reputations.\n+\n+Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n+We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n+individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n+proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n+be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n+\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\n+TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+\n+0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n+notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n+the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\n+to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\n+either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n+to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n+verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n+(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n+\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n+\n+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n+the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n+covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n+(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n+is true depends on what the Program does.\n+\n+1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n+code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n+and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n+and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n+this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n+recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n+\n+2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n+it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n+such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n+that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n+\n+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n+    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n+    under the terms of this License.\n+\n+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n+    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n+    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n+    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n+    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n+    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n+    is not required to print an announcement.)\n+\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n+can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n+the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n+License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n+whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n+\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n+collective works based on the Program.\n+\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n+storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n+scope of this License.\n+\n+3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n+\n+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n+    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n+    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n+    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n+    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n+    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n+    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n+    accord with Subsection b above.)\n+\n+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n+means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n+compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n+exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n+executable.\n+\n+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n+to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n+the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n+code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n+along with the object code.\n+\n+4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n+except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n+to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n+automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n+who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n+not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n+full compliance.\n+\n+5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n+signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n+distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n+its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n+Program or works based on it.\n+\n+6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n+these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n+on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\n+responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n+\n+7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\n+so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n+any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n+distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n+not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n+receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n+could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n+distribution of the Program.\n+\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n+circumstances.\n+\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n+by public license practices. Many people have made generous\n+contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\n+system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\n+the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n+software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n+\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n+a consequence of the rest of this License.\n+\n+8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n+add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n+countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n+not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n+limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n+\n+9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n+versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n+versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n+differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n+later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n+the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n+number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n+Free Software Foundation.\n+\n+10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n+author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n+Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n+sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n+two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n+software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n+\n+NO WARRANTY\n+\n+11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n+WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n+EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n+WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\n+ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\n+YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n+NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n+AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\n+DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n+DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n+(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n+INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\n+THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\n+OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n+\n+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n+\n+To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\n+attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\n+the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n+\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n+    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n+    (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n+    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n+    General Public License for more details.\n+\n+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n+    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n+    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n+\n+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n+\n+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n+when it starts in an interactive mode:\n+\n+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n+    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\n+    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n+\n+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\n+appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\n+you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\n+could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n+\n+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n+school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n+necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n+\n+    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n+    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by\n+    James Hacker.\n+\n+    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n+    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n+\n+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n+into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\n+may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\n+with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\n+General Public License instead of this License.\n+\n+__________________________________________\n+CLASSPATH EXCEPTION\n+__________________________________________\n+Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\n+making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\n+conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\n+combination.\n+\n+As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n+permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n+executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\n+modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\n+terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\n+independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\n+module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\n+based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\n+exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\n+do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement\n+from your version.\n+\n+__________________________\n+Notice.md\n+__________________________\n+Notices for Jakarta Mail\n+\n+This content is produced and maintained by the Jakarta Mail project.\n+\n+    Project home: https:\/\/projects.eclipse.org\/projects\/ee4j.mail\n+\n+Trademarks\n+\n+Jakarta Mail is a trademark of the Eclipse Foundation.\n+Copyright\n+\n+All content is the property of the respective authors or their employers.
