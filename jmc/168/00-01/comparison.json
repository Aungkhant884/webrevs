Performing heap inspection garbage collections may be a problem since they usually take a lot of time.&lt;p&gt;Some of these inspections were caused by the 'Object Count' JFR event. It triggers a full garbage collection at the beginning and end of every recording where that event is enabled. If recordings are only made on demand or not too often, then these garbage collections are usually not a problem since the resulting pauses are not part of the normal application behavior. If recordings are collected often, for example by automatic scripts, or if the application is sensitive to pauses, then it might become an issue.

The most common call site is 'weblogic.socket.NIOSocketMuxer$NIOOutputStream.initPool():887'.&lt;p&gt;Conversion from primitives to the corresponding object types can either be done explicitly, or be caused by autoboxing. If a considerable amount of the total allocation is caused by such conversions, consider changing the application source code to avoid this behavior. Look at the allocation stack traces to see which parts of the code to change.

This flag can be used together with the G1 garbage collector in JDK 8u20 or later, or with the Shenandoah garbage collector.&lt;p&gt;To validate if this gives a performance improvement for your application, create flight recordings both with and without string deduplication. For the run with string deduplication enabled, also enable statistics with '-XX:+PrintStringDeduplicationStatistics' for JDK 8 or '-Xlog:stringdedup*=debug' for JDK 9. Check if the heap live set decrease in the recording with string deduplication enabled is larger than the size of the string deduplication metadata table. The size of the metadata table is printed in the statistics output as 'Table\/Memory Usage: XX MB'&lt;p&gt;You can read more about string deduplication in the java options documentation or in &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jeps\/192\"&gt;JEP 192&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;String deduplication is only supported when using the G1 (JDK 8u20+) or Shenandoah garbage collectors.
