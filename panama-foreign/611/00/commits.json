[{"commit":{"message":"8276987: Optimized upcall stub should be printed with -XX:+PrintStubCode\n\nThat would allow it to be found by JMH's profasm which uses\n-XX:+PrintStubCode to collect the addresses of stubs.  Note that JMH at\nthe moment can't actually parse the stubs printed by\ntrace_new_stub (because they have a \"Decoding ...\" prefix and don't\ninclude the end address), but that can be fixed on the JMH side."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/code\/codeBlob.cpp"}],"sha":"1191288f4fd7a55b906dee010d8166bff5dcd69e"}]
