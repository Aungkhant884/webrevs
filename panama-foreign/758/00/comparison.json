In other words, we say that the above segment has an *unbounded* lifetime.\n+\n+Most programs, though, require off-heap memory to be deallocated  while the program is running, and thus need memory segments with *bounded* lifetimes. The simplest way to obtain a segment with bounded lifetime is to use an *automatic scope*:\n+\n+```java\n+MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(100, SegmentScope.auto());\n+```\n+\n+Segments associated with an automatic scope are alive as long as they are determined to be reachable by the garbage collector.

The arena scope is alive from the time when the arena is opened, until the time when the arena is closed. Multiple segments allocated with the same arena scope  enjoy the same bounded lifetime and can safely contain mutual references.

If an arena is opened and closed by the same thread, and all memory segments allocated with the arena's scope are accessed only  by that thread, then ensuring correctness is straightforward. However, if memory segments allocated with the arena scope are accessed by  multiple threads then ensuring correctness is complex. For example, a segment allocated with arena scope might be accessed by one thread while another thread attempts to close the arena. To guarantee temporal safety without making single-threaded clients pay undue cost, there are  two kinds of arenas: *confined* and *shared*.\n+\n+- A confined arena (`Arena::openConfined`) supports strong thread-confinement guarantees. A confined arena has an *owner thread*, typically the thread which opened it. The memory segments allocated in a confined arena (i.e., with the confined arena's scope) can be accessed  only by the owner thread. Any attempt to close the confined arena from a thread other than the owner thread will fail with an exception.\n+- A shared arena (`Arena::openShared`) has no owner thread.  The memory segments allocated in a shared arena can be accessed by  multiple threads. Moreover, a shared arena can be closed by any thread,  and the closure is guaranteed to be safe and atomic even under races<a href=\"#1\"><sup>1<\/sup><\/a>.\n+\n+In summary, a segment scope controls which threads can access a  memory segment, and when. A memory segment with global scope or  automatic scope can be accessed by any thread.

But there are cases where this behavior is not desirable: consider the case where a large memory segment is mapped from a file (this is possible using `MemorySegment::map`); in this case, an application would probably prefer to deterministically release (e.g. unmap) the memory associated with this segment, to ensure that memory doesn't remain available for longer than in needs to (and therefore potentially impacting the performance of the application).\n-\n-Memory segments support deterministic deallocation, through an abstraction called `MemorySession`. A memory session models the lifecycle associated with one or more memory resources (in this document, by memory resources we mean mostly memory segments); a memory session has a state: it starts off in the *alive* state, which means that all the resources it manages can be safely accessed â€” and, at the user's request, it can be *closed*. After a memory session is closed, access to resources managed by that session is no longer allowed. Memory sessions implement the `AutoCloseable` interface, and can therefore be used with the *try-with-resources* construct, as demonstrated in the following code:\n-\n-```java\n-try (MemorySession session = MemorySession.openConfined()) {\n-    MemorySegment mapped = MemorySegment.map(Path.of(\"someFile\"), 0, 100000, MapMode.READ_WRITE, session);    \n-} \/\/ segment is unmapped here\n-```\n-\n-Here, we create a new *confined* memory session, which is then used when creating a mapped segment; this means that the lifecycle of the `mapped` segment is tied to that of the memory session, and that accessing the segment (e.g. dereference) *after* `session` has been closed will not be possible.\n-\n-As this example alludes to, memory sessions can come in many flavors: they can be *confined* (where access is restricted to the thread which created the session), *shared* <a href=\"#3\"><sup>3<\/sup><\/a> (where access can occur in any thread) and can be optionally associated with a `Cleaner` object (as in the case of `openImplicit`), which performs *implicit* deallocation when the memory session becomes *unreachable* (if the `close` method has not been called by the user). Memory sessions are very handy when managing the lifecycle of multiple resources:\n-\n-```java\n-try (MemorySession session = MemorySession.openConfined()) {\n-    MemorySegment segment1 = MemorySegment.allocateNative(100, session);\n-    MemorySegment segment2 = MemorySegment.allocateNative(100, session);\n-    ...\n-    MemorySegment segmentN = MemorySegment.allocateNative(100, session);\n-} \/\/ all segments are deallocated here\n-```\n-\n-Here we create another confined session, and then, inside the *try-with-resources* we use the session to create many segments; all such segments share the *same* memory session â€” meaning that when such session is closed, the memory associated with all these segments will be reclaimed at once.\n-\n-#### Challenges\n-\n-Working with deterministic deallocation is great in terms of achieving better control as to *when* memory resources are released. But deterministic deallocation present some unique challenges which we discuss here; some of these issues might look surprising, especially coming from a world where deallocation happens implicitly (as in the ByteBuffer API). Consider the following method:\n-\n-```java\n-void m() {\n-    MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(MemorySession.openConfined());\n-    segment.set(JAVA_INT, 0, 42);\n-}\n-```\n-\n-This method creates a segment backed by a fresh confined memory session. But the session is not closed before the method returns. This means the off-heap memory associated with the native segment will never be released. In other words, we have created a *memory leak*. With power comes responsibility: clients must not forget to call the close method (unless they are working with a session backed by a `Cleaner` object, in which case the call will happen implicitly, of course).\n-\n-Another issue with deterministic deallocation is that it can sometimes be tricky to determine whether a certain access operation might fail or not. Consider the following method:\n-\n-```java\n-void accept(MemorySegment segment) {\n-   segment.setAtIndex(JAVA_INT, 0, 1);\n-   segment.setAtIndex(JAVA_INT, 1, 2);\n-}\n-```\n-\n-The first call to `setAtIndex` might fail, if the session associated to the segment has already been closed. But, if the segment is associated with a shared session, it might also be possible for the *second* call to fail (if some other thread has closed the session concurrently). To help clients running a sequence of operation against one or more segments in a more atomic fashion, the `MemorySession::whileAlive` method can be used:\n-\n-```java\n-void accept(MemorySegment segment) {\n-   segment.session().whileAlive(() -> {\n-       segment.setAtIndex(JAVA_INT, 0, 1);\n-       segment.setAtIndex(JAVA_INT, 1, 2);\n-   });\n-}\n-```\n-\n-Finally, when writing APIs returning memory segments, API authors might want to take extra caution so that the API private memory session is not leaked outside the API, through the memory segments generated by the API. Consider the following code:\n-\n-```java\n-class Allocator {\n-    private final MemorySession privateSession = MemorySession.openConfined();\n-    \n-    MemorySegment allocate(long byteSize) {\n-        return MemorySegment.allocateNative(byteSize, privateSession);\n-    }\n-}\n-```\n-\n-And now, consider the following client code:\n-\n-```java\n-Allocator allocator = new Allocator();\n-MemorySegment segment = allocator.allocate(100);\n-...\n-segment.session().close();\n-```\n-\n-The problem here is that the API is exposing its own memory session via the segment it returns; by doing so, clients can then access the session of the segments obtained from the API, and even *close* the session, thus releasing *all* the memory that has been allocated by the `Allocator` instance, even the memory associated with segments that the client knew nothing about. To help writing more robust APIs, the `MemorySession::asNonCloseable` method can be used, which obtain a *non-closeable* view of a given memory session:\n-\n-```java\n-class Allocator {\n-    private final MemorySession privateSession = MemorySession.openConfined();\n-    \n-    MemorySegment allocate(long byteSize) {\n-        return MemorySegment.allocateNative(byteSize, privateSession.asNonCloseable());\n-    }\n-}\n-```\n-\n-In the above example, we have tweaked the `Allocator::allocate` method so that it returns a segment associated with a non-closeable view of the private memory session. This means that clients of this method will no longer be able to call `MemorySession::close` on the returned segment.\n-\n-As we have seen in this session, deterministic deallocation, as most things in computer science, is a trade-off. More specifically, we are trading between predictability of deallocation and simplicity of API and user code. It is ultimately up to developers to pick the solution that works best for their use case. As a general (and rough!) rule of thumb, long-lived, shared memory resources might be better modelled using implicit memory sessions, whereas short-lived, thread-confined memory resources are often modelled using closeable memory sessions.\n-\n-### Streaming slices\n-\n-To process the contents of a memory segment in bulk, a memory segment can be turned into a stream of slices, using the `MemorySegment::stream` method:\n-\n-```java\n-SequenceLayout seq = MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(1_000_000, JAVA_INT);\n-SequenceLayout bulk_element = MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(100, JAVA_INT);\n-\n-try (MemorySession session = MemorySession.openShared()) {\n-    MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(seq, session);\n-    int sum = segment.elements(bulk_element).parallel()\n-                       .mapToInt(slice -> {\n-                           int res = 0;\n-                           for (int i = 0; i < 100 ; i++) {\n-                               res += slice.getAtIndex(JAVA_INT, i);\n-                           }\n-                           return res;\n-                       }).sum();\n-}\n-```\n-\n-The `MemorySegment::elements` method takes an element layout and returns a new stream.

Multiple module names can be specified in a comma-separated list, where the special name `ALL-UNNAMED` is used to enable restricted access for all code on the class path. If the `--enable-native-access` option is specified, any attempt to call restricted operations from a module not listed in the option will fail with a runtime exception.\n@@ -282,3 +205,3 @@\n-* <a id=\"1\"\/>(<sup>1<\/sup>):<small> In general, deriving a complete layout from a C `struct` declaration is no trivial matter, and it's one of those areas where tooling can help greatly.<\/small>\n-* <a id=\"2\"\/>(<sup>2<\/sup>):<small> Clients can enforce stricter type checking when interacting with `VarHandle` instances, by obtaining an *exact* var handle, using the `VarHandle::withInvokeExactBehavior` method.<\/small>\n-* <a id=\"3\"\/>(<sup>3<\/sup>):<small> Shared sessions rely on VM thread-local handshakes (JEP [312](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jeps\/312)) to implement lock-free, safe, shared memory access; that is, when it comes to memory access, there should no difference in performance between a shared segment and a confined segment.
