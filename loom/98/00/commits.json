[{"commit":{"message":"8282792: Loom: Fix optimized build after commit 4d2710\n\nIn commit 4d2710[1], one invocation of function print_frames() is moved\nfrom condition `!PRODUCT` to condition `ASSERT`. As a result, all the\nusages are now under condition `ASSERT`, leading to the compilation\nwarning \"unused-function\" in optimized VM build.\n\nHence, in this patch, we move the defintion of function print_frames()\nto condition `ASSERT`.\n\n[1] https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/loom\/commit\/4d2710#diff-74c5a41cb3476b29151b4a13732cf4756879de0aa1b1d8c4d73c38e570413fcfR2851"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/runtime\/continuation.cpp"}],"sha":"59b7e15892550a2a8434d2a736ce04553fec4785"}]
