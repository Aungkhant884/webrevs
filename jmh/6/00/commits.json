[{"commit":{"message":"Runner: if -Djmh.ignoreLock=true then skip jmh.lock creation\n\nWhen -Djmh.ignoreLock=true JMH anyway will try to create the jmh.lock file and if it fails it will write a warning for an user.\nThis may be not a best way for several reasons:\n1. If user specified ignoreLock then he already knows what she or he doing.\n2. If the Benchmark is started from IDE i.e idea-jmh-plugin and the ignoreLock was added automatically then users may be confused by this warning\n3. It makes execution slightly longer when we anyway trying to create the jmh.lock file\n4. This simplifies logic\n\nSigned-off-by: Sergey Ponomarev <stokito@gmail.com>"},"files":[{"filename":"jmh-core\/src\/main\/java\/org\/openjdk\/jmh\/runner\/Runner.java"}],"sha":"f5986702d52bc47d5efcca8e6dc8269d31b8479d"}]
