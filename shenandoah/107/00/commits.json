[{"commit":{"message":"Simplify crossing map implementation\n\nThe crossing map maintains a record of the first and last objects\nstarting within each remembered set card's range of memory addresses.\nThe previous implementations used bit-shifts.  It was detected during\ntesting that the c++ compiler was emitting incorrect code in certain\nin-line expansions of the register_object() method.  gdb reports that\nthere are 56 distinct contexts holding the expansion of this function.\nThis simplified implementation does not exhibit the same broken\nbehavior."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahScanRemembered.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahScanRemembered.inline.hpp"}],"sha":"b562a0b4961ff1431a886ec83405b3bbf2c6702a"}]
