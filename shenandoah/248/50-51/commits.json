[{"commit":{"message":"Improve handoff of generation sizing impacts\n\nAt the end of a completed GC cycle, we make adjustments in the\ngeneration sizes.  These adjusted are based on the number of trash\nregions (the size of the just-evacuated collection set) and the number\nof regions needed within old-gen to support any mixed evacuation effort\nor promotion that is anticipated to happen during the next GC cycle.\nRecycling of trashed regions and transfer of region membership between\ngenerations happens after we rebuild the free set.  This commit assures that\nthe free set rebuild process know how much memory will eventually be\navailable in each generation after we finish reclaiming trashed regions\nand transfering regions between generations."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahControlThread.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahFreeSet.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahFreeSet.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahFullGC.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahGeneration.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahHeap.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahOldGeneration.cpp"}],"sha":"4298ca7e249330b3ca4e5ed8c106e2f9f7870675"}]
