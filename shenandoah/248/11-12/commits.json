[{"commit":{"message":"Overwrite update_water_mark in ShenandoahHeapRegion::promote_in_place\n\nWhile a region waits to be promoted in place, its value of top equals\nend.  This is a temporary arrangement, to prevent young-gen objects\nfrom being allocated within this region before it is promoted.  Once\nthe region is promoted, its value of top() is adjusted to its previous\nvalue.  The region's update_watermark value was likely set when the\nregion had its artificially high value of top.  So we fix it here."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahHeapRegion.cpp"}],"sha":"9a15b8e1cd933729bc6a37ef2fd8011f8caf2d0a"}]
