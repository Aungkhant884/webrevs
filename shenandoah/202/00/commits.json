[{"commit":{"message":"8298647: GenShen require heap size 2MB granularity\n\nGenerational Shenandoah requires 2MB granularity in order for card\ntables to cover the allocated heap. Each byte in a page of card table\nrepresents 512 heap bytes. As card tables are allocated 4KB at a time,\n4KB * 512 = 2MB.\n\nThere is a circular dependency between the region calculations and the\nheap size calculations. This unconditionally rounds up the heap size to\n2MB. It might be preferable to do this only when generational mode is\nenabled.\n\nRunning with:\n  java -Xlog:gc*=trace -XX:+UseShenandoahGC -mx495m \\\n       -XX:ShenandoahGCMode=generational -version\n\non a debug build is sufficient to reproduce this problem."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahHeapRegion.cpp"}],"sha":"571fe68a54a6c6a0e26cad25b6b98227b01f3e15"}]
