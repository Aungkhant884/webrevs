Usually this is a \"good thing\", e.g., when you are backporting a fix to an earlier release, but not always... If the main bug is targeted to a later release (due to schedule planning), but someone finds the time to fix that bug in the current release, then the bug should be retargeted to the current release before pushing the fix.

The same procedure can be used in the opposite situation, when a fix has been pushed to JDK N+1 when the JBS bug was targeted to JDK N, by switching N and N+1 below. Remember, to keep the record clean for the future, what matters the most is that the bug id used in the commit comment is the main bug, and that the \"backports\" (regardless of if they are to earlier or later releases) are Backport type issues of that main issue.

JBS labels are an open namespace, which means that anyone can create new labels at any time. In order to avoid confusion, however, it's best to reuse existing labels where possible.
