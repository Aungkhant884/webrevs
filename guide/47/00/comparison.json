It was created in November 2006, when initial portions of the JDK source code were published under the GPLv2 license.\n+\n+In order to work together efficiently, clear directions are sometimes needed to avoid misconceptions and to align developers' views of terminology and process. The OpenJDK Community is a fairly pragmatic place. \"Do the right thing\" is most often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way then everyone's work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the recommended ways to do things.\n+\n+The goal of this guide is to answer questions that developers of the JDK might have around development process, tooling, standards, and so forth. The formal rules and processes are described in other documents, such as [JEP 1](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jeps\/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal & Roadmap Process, and [JEP 3](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jeps\/3) for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement to such documents, with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest of the OpenJDK Community.\n+\n+There are many common use cases that aren't detailed in the formal process. This guide suggests how to work in such cases.\n+\n+## I have a patch, what do I do?\n+\n+::: {.box}\n+[Quick Links]{.boxheader}\n+\n+* [Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA)](https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technical-resources\/oracle-contributor-agreement.html)\n+* [JDK Bug System (JBS)](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/)\n+* [OpenJDK Project Roles](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project-roles)\n+:::\n+\n+In many GitHub projects the standard way to propose a change is to create a pull request (PR) and discuss the patch in the PR. For OpenJDK projects the situation is somewhat different. The JDK is used for mission critical applications and by millions of developers, the bar to contributing changes is high. Please follow the steps outlined below to make sure your change passes above the bar before creating a PR.\n+\n+### 1. Sign the OCA\n+\n+Oracle is the steward of the OpenJDK project. In order to make your patch available for review you must first sign the [Oracle Contributor Agreement](https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technical-resources\/oracle-contributor-agreement.html) (OCA). This agreement gives Oracle and you as a contributor joint copyright interests in the code. You will retain your copyright while also granting those rights to Oracle.\n+\n+When you sign the OCA, please make sure that you specify your GitHub user name in the `Username` field of the OCA. If you try to create a PR before you have signed the OCA, or if you didn't specify your GitHub user name, you'll get instructions telling you to do so, and the PR won't be published until this is done. OCA registration is a manual process. Please allow for up to several days to have your OCA application processed, even though it's normally processed swiftly.\n+\n+### 2. Socialize your change\n+\n+Once the OCA is signed, please restrain your urge to create a PR just a little while longer. In order to prepare the community for your patch, please socialize your idea on the relevant [mailing lists](#mailing-lists). Almost all changes, and in particular any API changes, must go this route and have a broad agreement in place before there is any point in presenting code. To understand the criteria by which your patch is going to be judged, please read [_Why is My Change Rejected?_](#why-is-my-change-rejected) below. In short, hidden constraints and assumptions, stability and quality, maintainability, compatibility, and conformance to specifications must be considered before your PR is ready to be submitted. If you don't understand the constraints for acceptance, you might be surprised when your PR is rejected.\n+\n+### 3. Find a sponsor\n+\n+Socializing your change on the mailing lists also prevents the surprise that would otherwise make the community choke on their morning coffee when they see a huge patch in a new, unknown PR. As a new developer in the community you'll need to make a few friends that agree with your change. There are many good reasons to make friends, but the one relevant here is that for your first changes you'll need a sponsor to facilitate the integration of your work. The sponsor will perform any number of administrative tasks like JBS updates, additional testing, etc. It's usual for a sponsor to also be a reviewer of a change and thus familiar with it, but it's not a requirement.\n+\n+### 4. Create a tracking issue in JBS\n+\n+Many OpenJDK projects require a tracking issue to be filed in the [JDK Bug System (JBS)](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/) before a change can be pushed. This is the case for instance for the JDK and the JDK-Updates projects. In order to get write access to JBS you need to be an [Author](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#author) in an OpenJDK project. For your first changes, ask your sponsor to help you create the issue.\n+\n+If you continue to contribute high-quality content you'll soon enough be eligible for OpenJDK roles in the project. First Author, and later Committer. The Committer role means you won't need a sponsor anymore. You can read more about [OpenJDK Project Roles](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project-roles).\n+\n+### 5. Get acquainted with local process\n+\n+Even though we strive to unify how things are done within the OpenJDK, different areas and projects in the OpenJDK may have slight variations in how they work. Some of these differences are highlighted throughout this guide, some aren't. If you're new to an area, make sure you understand local differences before you proceed. Ask your sponsor who should be your main point of contact through your first developer experience in the OpenJDK.\n+\n+## Why is my change rejected?\n+\n+::: {.box}\n+[Quick Links]{.boxheader}\n+\n+* [Java Language and Virtual Machine Specifications](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/specs\/)\n+* [Java API Specification](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/en\/java\/javase\/15\/docs\/api\/index.html)\n+* [CSR Process](https:\/\/wiki.openjdk.java.net\/display\/csr\/Main)\n+:::\n+\n+Java and the JDK are very popular products, and just about every Java developer out there has an idea or two for how to enhance something. And (obviously not referring to you) believe it or not, not every idea is a good idea. Even though many ideas are indeed good, we must be quite restrictive on what we actually include into the JDK. There are many reasons for this.\n+\n+* **Hidden constraints and assumptions**. Many sections of code have constraints and assumptions that aren't necessarily visible at first glance. This might preclude certain changes, even those that might seem obvious.\n+\n+* **Stability and quality**. The JDK is used by millions of developers and as a widely deployed commercial product, it's held to a high standard of quality. Changes should include tests where practical, and core tests should pass at all times. The value of the change should outweigh the risk of introducing a bug or performance regression.\n+\n+* **Maintainability**. Any new feature or code change will need to be maintained in the JDK essentially forever, thus imposing a maintenance burden on future maintainers. The code might still be in use long after you and the people who reviewed it have moved on. New maintainers must be able to understand how to fix bugs in this code.\n+\n+* **Complexity**. Each new feature interacts with all the existing features, which can result in geometric growth of the interactions among features if features are added unchecked. Sometimes we avoid adding a new feature, even if it seems like an obvious thing to add, if that feature would make it difficult to add a more important feature in the future.\n+\n+* **Adherence to specifications**. Much of the JDK is governed by a series of specifications, in particular the [Java Language Specification](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/specs\/), the [Java Virtual Machine Specification](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/specs\/), and the [Java API Specification](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/en\/java\/javase\/15\/docs\/api\/index.html) (\"javadocs\"). All changes must be checked and tested carefully to ensure that they don't violate these specifications.\n+\n+* **Javadoc comments are specifications**. The Java API Specification is authored in the form of javadoc comments, so even apparently innocuous changes to comments can be quite significant. It's not always easy to tell what comments are part of the specification and what parts are merely code comments. Briefly, documentation comments on public packages, classes, and class members of exported modules are specifications.\n+\n+* **Specification changes**. It's possible to change the API specifications, and this is done regularly. However, these changes require even more scrutiny than code changes. This extra review is handled by the [CSR Process](https:\/\/wiki.openjdk.java.net\/display\/csr\/Main). Specifications are written in stylized, somewhat formal language, and they don't simply describe what the code does. Writing specifications is a separate skill from coding.\n+\n+* **Compatibility**. Changes should also adhere to high standards of binary, source, and behavioral compatibility. The compatibility impact of apparently innocuous changes is sometimes startling.\n+\n+For reasons like these it’s quite possible that your change, even though it adds value to you, isn’t deemed to add enough value to the larger community.\n","filename":"src\/guide\/01-introduction.md","additions":77,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":77,"status":"added"},{"patch":"@@ -0,0 +1,45 @@\n+# Mailing Lists\n+\n+::: {.box}\n+[Quick Links]{.boxheader}\n+\n+* [OpenJDK Mailing Lists Manager](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net\/mailman\/listinfo)\n+:::\n+\n+The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.

A subscriber to an OpenJDK mailing list is referred to as a [Participant](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#participant) in the [Bylaws](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws). As a general recommendation we suggest to subscribe to [announce](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net\/mailman\/listinfo\/announce), [discuss](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net\/mailman\/listinfo\/discuss), and the `-dev` lists covering your explicit area of interest.

To keep it that way it's important to keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global. Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists. Even though English is the required language for all lists, many Participants speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect English is expected from anyone joining these lists. You're also strongly encouraged to use your real name on the mailing lists. This adds to the professional tone of your email. Postings from anonymized mailboxes risk being seen as spam. If you do work in the OpenJDK on behalf of your employer, please also list this affiliation. If your GitHub username differs from your real name it's also a good idea to include that to identify yourself and your actions on GitHub.\n+\n+You must be a member of a list to be able to post to that list. Some lists are moderated to keep the content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older conversations on the list.\n+\n+There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what the list is intended for, `<name>-<suffix>`. The name often refers to the project that owns the list or a specific area of interest that the list focuses on. The suffix is explained below. Not all projects or areas have all types of lists described here.\n+\n+> `-dev`\n+> :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This is also where code reviews happen.\n+\n+> `-use`\n+> :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.\n+\n+> `-discuss`\n+> :    General discussions around the project.

Some Projects may choose to organize their code into multiple, possibly related, Mercurial repositories. For instance, [JDK 9](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/jdk9) uses a forest of multiple related repositories which contain components of the entire JDK. Projects which are based on the JDK, such as [IcedTea](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/icedtea) and [Jigsaw](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/jigsaw) also use this model. In contrast, [Code Tools](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/code-tools) uses an unrelated repository for each tool and [Graal](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/graal) uses only a single repository. Regardless of how a Project has chosen to store their code, each [Contributor](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#contributor) clones the repository associated with the code they are modifying.\n+\n+> ---\n+> Consult the Project's documentation or [mailing list](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net) to determine the appropriate repository, development conventions, and helpful tools.\n+\n+> ---\n+\n+This is the typical development model:\n+\n+::: {style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n+~~~{.mermaid caption=\"Diagram of server repos and user's clone\" format=svg theme=neutral}\n+graph TD\n+    subgraph hg.openjdk.java.net\n+        origin(jdk9\/dev)\n+    end\n+    origin --> |clone| local(9dev)\n+    local --> |push| origin\n+~~~\n+:::\n+\n+A Contributor creates a _clone_ (a local copy called \"9dev\") of a read\/write repository (\"jdk9\/dev\") which resides on the OpenJDK Mercurial server. They work on their change in the clone and locally _commit_ a changeset. After the new changeset(s) are verified, they're either _pushed_ directly from the clone or _exported_ and delivered to a [Committer](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#committer) who can perform the push into the server repository for all to see.\n+\n+> ---\n+> The use of _gate repositories_ was eliminated when the Mercurial servers were upgraded in March 2014.\n+\n+> ---\n+\n+The repositories use the following naming scheme:\n+\n+> `<project>\/<component_path>`\n+\n+where\n+\n+> ------------------  ----  ----------------------------------------------------\n+> _project_            ::   the short name of an OpenJDK [Project](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project) such as \"jdk9\", \"openjfx\", or \"sumatra\"\n+> _component_path_     ::   the path to a repository containing the code base as designated by the [Project Lead](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project-lead).\n+> ------------------  ----  ----------------------------------------------------\n+\n+## Installing and Configuring Mercurial\n+\n+Mercurial is a free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source bundles and binary packages for Mercurial are available at [https:\/\/www.selenic.com\/mercurial\/wiki\/index.cgi](https:\/\/www.selenic.com\/mercurial\/wiki\/index.cgi\/Mercurial). The OpenJDK repositories recommend installation of Mercurial 2.6.3 (or later). A Mercurial installation is sufficient to clone a repository. Contributors who wish to submit changes will need some additional configuration as described below.\n+\n+Some Projects may recommend additional tools or scripts that help with repository manipulation and code development. For instance, in JDK 9, the utility script `common\/bin\/hgforest.sh` may be used to apply commands to all the repositories in the [forest](#forest). Popular extensions for OpenJDK developers include [jcheck](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/code-tools\/jcheck\/), [trees](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/code-tools\/trees\/), and [Mercurial Queues](http:\/\/hgbook.red-bean.com\/read\/managing-change-with-mercurial-queues.html) (mq).

Depending on your role in the OpenJDK you can either use the [Bug Report Tool](https:\/\/bugreport.java.com\/) or, if you are [Author](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#author) in an OpenJDK [Project](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project), report the bug directly in the [JDK Bug System](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/). Try to make the bug report as complete as possible to make it easier to triage and investigate the bug.\n+\n+It's not the reporter's responsibility to set a correct priority, but a qualified guess is always better than a default value. To help with setting the right priority consider things like how the bug impacts the product and our testing, how likely is it that the bug triggers, how difficult is it to work around the bug if it's not fixed soon, and whether it's a recent regression, since that may break existing applications. Regressions are often higher priority than long standing bugs and may block a release if not fixed.\n+\n+A few things to keep in mind when filing a new bug:\n+\n+* Before filing a bug, verify that there isn't already a bug filed for this issue.\n+* If you suspect that the bug is a vulnerability, don't file a JBS issue. Instead send your bugreport to [vuln-dev@openjdk.java.net](mailto:vuln-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n+* Make a reasonable attempt to narrow down which build or release the failure first appeared in.\n+* Add relevant labels like [`intermittent`](#intermittent), [`regression`](#regression), [`noreg-self`](#noreg-self), ['tier1'](#tier) etc.\n+* Set affects version to the JDK version(s) where the failure was seen.\n+  * If the failure is found in an update train of the JDK (e.g. 11.0.x), please make an effort to see if the bug is also present in [mainline](https:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/jdk\/jdk\/).\n+* Set priority (see above)\n+* In the description, always include (if possible):\n+  * full name of the failing tests\n+  * error messages\n+  * assert messages\n+  * stack trace\n+  * command line information\n+  * relevant information from the logs\n+* If the failure isn't reproducible with an existing OpenJDK test, attach a reproducer if possible.\n+* Only set CPU and\/or OS fields if the bug **ONLY** happens on that particular platform.\n+* Always file separate bugs for different issues.\n+  * If two crashes looks related but not similar enough to for sure be the same, it's easier to close a bug as a duplicate than it is to extract the relevant info from a bug to create a new one later.\n+\n+To find out which component to use for different bugs, consult the [directory to area mapping](#directory-to-area-mapping).\n+\n+## How to fix an incorrect backport creation\n+\n+If a main bug is targeted to a release and the fix is pushed to a different release, then a backport bug is automatically created. Usually this is a \"good thing\", e.g., when you are backporting a fix to an earlier release, but not always... If the main bug is targeted to a later release (due to schedule planning), but someone finds the time to fix that bug in the current release, then the bug should be retargeted to the current release before pushing the fix. However, sometimes we forget to do that.\n+\n+Here is how to fix that:\n+\n+> ---\n+> In this example a fix was pushed to JDK N (a.k.a. the current release) while the JBS bug was targeted to JDK N+1 (a.k.a. a future release).\n+\n+> ---\n+\n+#. Reopen the _backport_ bug that was created automatically\n+   * Use a comment like the following (in the reopen dialog):\n+~~~\n+Fix was pushed while main bug was targeted to 'N+1'. Reset the main bug to fixed in 'N', reset this bug to fix in 'N+1' and closed as 'Not An Issue' since JDK N+1 will automatically get this fix from JDK N.\n+~~~\n+   * Change the 'Fix Version\/s' from 'N' to 'N+1'.\n+   * Close the _backport_ bug as \"Not an Issue\".\n+#. Clean up the _main_ bug\n+   * Copy the open push notification comment from the _backport_ bug to the _main_ bug, e.g.:\n+~~~\n+Changeset: 12345678\n+Author: Duke <duke@openjdk.org>\n+Date: 2020-10-23 15:37:46 +0000\n+URL: https:\/\/git.openjdk.java.net\/jdk\/commit\/12345678\n+~~~\n+   * Add a comment like the following to the _main_ bug:\n+~~~\n+Fix was pushed while main bug was targeted to 'N+1'. Reset the main bug to fixed in 'N' and copied the Robo Duke entry here.\n+~~~\n+   * Reset the _main_ bug 'Fix Version\/s' from 'N+1' to 'N'.\n+   * Resolve the _main_ bug as \"Fixed\" in build \"team\" or in build \"master\" depending on where the fix was pushed. Pushes to 'openjdk\/jdk' are fixed in build \"master\" and pushes to project repositories are fixed in build \"team\".\n+\n+## Resolved - Incomplete\n+\n+To resolve an issue as `Incomplete` is JBS lingo for \"Need More Information\". An issue that is `Resolved - Incomplete` is *not* closed but more information is needed to be able to work on it. If no more information is obtained within reasonable time the issue should be closed (`Closed - Incomplete`). Closing a resolved issue is done using the `Verify` option.\n+\n+## JBS Label Dictionary\n+\n+This table contains some frequently used JBS labels and their meaning. Please help keeping this dictionary up to date by adding your favorite labels. This table doesn’t dictate how to use labels, but rather document how they are used. That said, obviously it will help everyone if we try to follow a common standard and use similar labels in the same way across all entities that use JBS.\n+\n+Labels are an open namespace, which means that anyone can create new labels at any time. In order to avoid confusion, however, it's best to reuse existing labels where possible. This can be done by editing the \"labels\" field of a bug and entering the first few characters of the label you want to add. JIRA will pop up an autocomplete window with existing labels that match that prefix. Then choose one of the existing labels. Using the autocomplete window is preferable to typing the whole label name (even if you're a good typist) because it's easy for minor spelling errors to creep in, which can inadvertently introduce multiple labels with spurious spelling variations.\n+\n+> ---\n+> ### Labels are case sensitive\n+> When using labels in Jira gadgets (like pie charts, heat maps, and statistics tables) Jira will be case sensitive and treat e.g. OpenJDK and openjdk as two different labels. Searching however is case insensitive. This means that if you group a set of issues in a gadget based on a label, and then click one of the groups to see the list of issues, that list will contain more results than the gadget if there are usages of the label with different casing. This can be very confusing and for this reason the recommendation is to stick with the commonly used case for all labels, regardless of your personal taste for upper or lower case letters. Most labels are lower case only, but there are examples where upper case letters are used in the most common version of a label. Use of the autocomplete popup window (described above) when adding labels will avoid inadvertent introduction of labels with differing case.\n+\n+> ---\n+\n+<table class=\"dictionary\">\n+  <tr style=\"text-align:left;\"><th>Label<\/th><th>Description<\/th><\/tr>\n+  <tr>\n+    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n+      [*(Area)***`-interest`**]{#area-interest}\n+    <\/td>\n+    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n+      Used to indicate that an area (usually a team or project) is interested in the issue.

If you see a problem that is causing pain for a large number of maintainers, add an explanation in the JBS issue to why you think the issue is a pain and add the label.\n+\n+If you have a **`maintainer-pain`** bug assigned to you please consider fixing it asap.

Another way to reduce the noise is to [exclude the failing test](#excluding-a-test). This is a viable option if there is a limited set of tests that are failing and the bug is actively investigated. When excluding a **`maintainer-pain`** issue, remember to move the **`maintainer-pain`** label to the JBS issue used to exclude.

JTReg is a Java regression test framework that is used for most of the tests that are included in the OpenJDK source repository. The Google Test (GTest) framework is intended for unit testing of the C++ native code. Currently only JVM testing is supported by the GTest framework. Other areas use JTReg for unit testing of C++ code.\n+\n+This section provides a brief summary of how to get started with testing in OpenJDK. For more information on configuration and how to use the OpenJDK test framework, a.k.a. \"run-test framework\", see [`doc\/testing.md`](https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/doc\/testing.md).\n+\n+In general all changes should come with a regression test so if you're writing product code you should also be writing test code. There are a few examples where it doesn't make sence to write an explicit regression test. These should be tagged in JBS with one of the [noreg-labels](#noreg).\n+\n+A few key items to think about when writing a regression test:\n+\n+* A regression test should execute fast - a few seconds at most\n+* The test should only test the desired functionality - if you have several features to test, write more tests\n+* The test should pass reliably on all supported platforms - watch out for platform-specific differences such as path separators\n+* Binary files shouldn't be checked in, if your test needs to use one, the test should create it in some fashion\n+* Avoid shell scripts and relying on external commands as much as possible\n+\n+The JTReg documentation has a section on [how to write good JTReg tests](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/writetests.html).\n+\n+## JTReg\n+\n+In-depth documentation about the JTReg framework is found here: [JTReg harness](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/). JTReg itself is available in the [Code Tools Project](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/code-tools\/).\n+\n+Below is a small example of a JTReg test. It’s a clean Java class with a main method that is called from the test harness. If the test fails we throw a RuntimeException. This is picked up by the harness and is reported as a test failure. Try to always write a meaningful message in the exception. One that actually helps with understanding what went wrong once the test fails.\n+\n+    \/*\n+     * @test\n+     * @summary Make sure feature X handles Y correctly\n+     * @run main TestXY\n+     *\/\n+    public class TestXY {\n+        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n+            var result = X.y();\n+            if (result != expected_result) {\n+                throw new RuntimeException(\"X.y() gave \" + result + \", expexted \" + expected_result);\n+            }\n+        }\n+    }\n+\n+This example only utilizes three JTReg specific tags, `@test`, `@summary`, and `@run`. `@test` simply tells JTReg that this class is a test, and `@summary` provides a description of the test. `@run` tells JTReg how to execute the test. In this case we simply tell JTReg to execute the main method of the class `TestXY`. `@run` isn't strictly necessary for JTReg to execute the test, an implicit `@run` tag will be added if none exists. However, for clarity and in order to avoid bugs it's recommended to always explicitly use the `@run` tag.\n+\n+There are several other tags that can be used in JTReg tests. You can for instance associate the test with a specific bug that this test is a regression test for.\n+\n+    @bug 7000001\n+\n+Or you can specify a number of requirements that must be fulfilled for JTReg to execute the test.\n+\n+    @requires docker.support\n+    @requires os.family != ”windows”\n+    @requires os.maxMemory > 3G\n+    @requires os.arch==\"x86_64\" | os.arch==\"amd64\"\n+\n+You can also specify if the test requires specific modules, and you can specify command line flags and run the test in several different ways.\n+\n+    @modules java.base\/jdk.internal.misc\n+    @run main\/othervm -Xmx128m TestXY\n+\n+Note that you can have several `@run` tags in the same test with different command line options.\n+\n+JTReg also have support for labeling tests with keys using the `@key` tag. These keywords can then be used to filter the test selection. For instance if you have a UI test which needs to display a window you'll want to make sure the test harness doesn't try to run this test on a system which doesn't support headful tests. You do this by specifying\n+\n+    @key headful\n+\n+Another example is `@key randomness` that should be used to indicate that a test is using randomness - i.e. is intentionally non-deterministic.\n+\n+There are many other keywords in use and their usage may differ between areas in the JDK. Make sure you understand the conventions for the particular area you are testing since these are just examples.\n+\n+The [JTReg documentation](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/) provides information on many more tags like these.\n+\n+The [compiler group](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/groups\/compiler\/) has a section in their wiki with [Guidelines for \"langtools\" tests](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/groups\/compiler\/tests.html).\n+\n+### Running OpenJDK JTReg Tests\n+\n+When configuring the OpenJDK build you can tell it where your JTReg installation is located. When providing this information you can later run `make run-test` to execute JTReg tests.\n+\n+    sh .\/configure --with-jtreg=\/path\/to\/jtreg\n+    make run-test TEST=tier1\n+\n+In the OpenJDK source tree you can find a directory called `test`. There are a large number of tests in this directory that are written to be used with JTReg.\n+\n+    make run-test TEST=test\/jdk\/java\/lang\/String\/\n+\n+You can also run JTReg without invoking make. In this case you’ll need to tell JTReg which JDK to test.\n+\n+    jtreg -jdk:\/path\/to\/jdk \/path\/to\/test\n+\n+## GTest\n+\n+As mentioned the Google test framework is mainly used for C++ unit tests. There are several of these in the `test\/hotspot` directory. Currently, only the C++ code in the JVM area is supported by the OpenJDK GTest framework. The tests can be run without starting the JVM, which enables testing of JVM data structures that would be fragile to play with in a running JVM.\n+\n+    static int demo_comparator(int a, int b) {\n+      if (a == b) {\n+        return 0;\n+      }\n+      if (a < b) {\n+        return -1;\n+      }\n+      return 1;\n+    }\n+\n+    TEST(Demo, quicksort) {\n+      int test_array[] = {7,1,5,3,6,9,8,2,4,0};\n+      int expected_array[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};\n+\n+      QuickSort::sort(test_array, 10, demo_comparator, false);\n+      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n+        ASSERT_EQ(expected_array[i], test_array[i]);\n+      }\n+    }\n+\n+`ASSERT_EQ` is one example of an assertion that can be used in the test. Below are a few other examples. A full list is found in the [Google Test Documentation](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/googletest\/blob\/master\/googletest\/docs\/primer.md).\n+\n+    ASSERT_TRUE(condition);\n+    ASSERT_FALSE(condition);\n+    EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);\n+    EXPECT_LT(val1, val2);\n+    EXPECT_STREQ(expected_str, actual_str);\n+\n+`ASSERT` is a fatal assertion and will interrupt execution of the current sub-routine. `EXPECT` is a nonfatal assertion and will report the error but continues to run the test. All assertions have both an `ASSERT` and an `EXPECT` variant.\n+\n+For more information on how to write good GTests in HotSpot, see [`doc\/hotspot-unit-tests.md`](https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/doc\/hotspot-unit-tests.md).\n+\n+### Running OpenJDK GTests\n+\n+When configuring the OpenJDK build you can tell it where your GTest installation is located. Once configured, use make to run GTests.\n+\n+    sh .\/configure --with-gtest=\/path\/to\/gtest\n+    make test TEST=gtest\n+\n+You can also use a regular expression to filter which tests to run:\n+\n+    make test TEST=gtest:code.*:os.*\n+    make test TEST=gtest:$X\/$variant\n+\n+The second example above runs tests which match the regexp `$X.*` on a specific variant of the JVM. The variant is one of client, server, etc.\n+\n+## Excluding a Test\n+\n+Sometimes tests break. It could be e.g. due to bugs in the test itself, due to changed functionality in the code that the test is testing, or changes in the environment where the test is executed. While working on a fix, it can be useful to stop the test from being executed in everyone else's testing to reduce noise, especially if the test is expected to fail for more than a day. There are two ways to stop a test from being run in standard test runs: ProblemListing and using the `@ignore` keyword. Removing tests isn't the standard way to remove a failure. A failing test is often a regression and should ideally be handled with high urgency.\n+\n+I'll say it right away so that it's not forgotten at the end: Remember to remove the JBS id from the ProblemList or the test when the bug is closed. This is especially easy to forget if a bug is closed as a duplicate or 'Will Not Fix'. jcheck will report an error and prohibit a push if a PR is created for an issue that is found in a ProblemList if the fix doesn't remove the bug ID from the ProblemList.\n+\n+### ProblemListing jtreg tests\n+\n+ProblemListing should be used for a short term exclusion while a test is being fixed, and for the exclusion of intermittently failing tests that cause too much noise, but can still be useful to run on an ad-hoc basis. ProblemListing is done in the file `ProblemList.txt`. There are actually several ProblemList files to choose from. Their location and name hint about what area or feature each file belongs to. Each file has sections for different components. All ProblemList files complement each other to build the total set of tests to exclude in JTReg runs.\n+\n+~~~\n+test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList.txt\n+test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-aot.txt\n+test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-graal.txt\n+test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-non-cds-mode.txt\n+test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-Xcomp.txt\n+test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-zgc.txt\n+test\/jaxp\/ProblemList.txt\n+test\/jdk\/ProblemList.txt\n+test\/jdk\/ProblemList-aot.txt\n+test\/jdk\/ProblemList-graal.txt\n+test\/jdk\/ProblemList-Xcomp.txt\n+test\/langtools\/ProblemList.txt\n+test\/langtools\/ProblemList-graal.txt\n+test\/lib-test\/ProblemList.txt\n+~~~\n+\n+Use the suitable ProblemList and add a line like this in the proper section:\n+\n+~~~\n+foo\/bar\/MyTest.java                        4711   windows-all\n+~~~\n+\n+In this example, `MyTest.java` is ProblemListed on windows, tracked by bug `JDK-4711`.\n+\n+Currently there's [no support for multiple lines for the same test](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/browse\/CODETOOLS-7902481). For this reason it's important to always make sure there's no existing entry for the test before adding a new one, as multiple entries might lead to unexpected results, e.g.\n+\n+~~~\n+foo\/bar\/MyTest.java                        4710   generic-all\n+...\n+foo\/bar\/MyTest.java                        4711   windows-all\n+~~~\n+\n+This would lead to `sun.tools.jcmd.MyTest.java` being ProblemListed only on `windows-all`. The proper way to write this is:\n+\n+~~~\n+foo\/bar\/MyTest.java                        4710,4711   generic-all,windows-all\n+~~~\n+\n+Although `windows-all` isn't strictly required in this example, it's preferable to specify platforms for each bugid (unless they are all `generic-all`), this makes it easier to remove one of the bugs from the list.\n+\n+#### ProblemListing some, but not all, test cases in a file\n+\n+Some tests contain several test cases and there may be a need to ProblemList only a few of them. To do this use the full test name, i.e. `<filename> + # + <test case id>`, where test case id can be specified in the test header. If no id is specified each test case can be referenced with `id` + ordinary number of the test case in the test file.\n+\n+Let's assume we have four test cases in `foo\/bar\/MyTest.java`:\n+\n+~~~\n+\/* @test *\/\n+\/* @test id=fancy_name *\/\n+\/* @test *\/\n+\/* @test *\/\n+~~~\n+\n+A ProblemList entry that excludes the first, second, and third test case would look like this:\n+\n+~~~\n+foo\/bar\/MyTest.java#id0          4720  generic-all\n+foo\/bar\/MyTest.java#fancy_name   4721  generic-all\n+foo\/bar\/MyTest.java#id2          4722  generic-all\n+~~~\n+\n+Due to an issue described in [CODETOOLS-7902712](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/browse\/CODETOOLS-7902712) tests that contains more than one `@test` must actually use this way to specify all test cases if all of them should be ProblemListed. Specifying just the test name will not work.\n+\n+#### Running ProblemListed tests\n+\n+To run ad-hoc runs of ProblemListed tests use `RUN_PROBLEM_LISTS=true`.\n+\n+~~~\n+make test TEST=... JTREG=RUN_PROBLEM_LISTS=true\n+~~~\n+\n+### Exclude jtreg tests using `@ignore`\n+\n+The `@ignore` keyword is used in the test source code. This is mainly used for tests that are so broken that they may be harmful or useless, and is less common than ProblemListing. Examples can be tests that don't compile because something changed in the platform; or a test which might remove your `\/etc\/shadow`. Use `@ignore` with a bug reference in the test case to prevent the test from being run.\n+\n+~~~java\n+\/**\n+ *  @test\n+ *  @ignore 4711\n+ *\n+~~~\n+\n+In this example, `MyTest.java` is excluded, tracked by bug `JDK-4711`. `@ignore` should always be placed directly before the first `@run` line in the test.\n+\n+### Dealing with JBS bugs for test exclusion\n+\n+ProblemListing and `@ignore`-ing are done in the JDK source tree, that means a check-in into the repository is needed. This in turn means that a unique JBS issue and a code review are needed. This is a good thing since it makes test problems visible.\n+\n+* **Code review**: ProblemListing a test is considered a [trivial](#trivial) change.\n+* **JBS issue**: A JBS issue is obviously created for the bug that caused the failure, we call this the _main issue_. To exclude the test, create a subtask to the main issue. Also add the label [`problemlist`](#problemlist) to the main issue.\n+\n+The fix for the main issue should remove the test from the ProblemList or remove the `@ignore` keyword from the test.\n+\n+#### Triage excluded issues\n+\n+After a failure is handled by excluding a test, the main JBS issue should be re-triaged and possibly given a new priority. This should be handled by the standard triage process. A test exclusion results in an outage in our testing. This outage should be taken into consideration when triaging, in addition to the impact of the bug itself.\n","filename":"src\/guide\/07-testing-the-jdk.md","additions":250,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":250,"status":"added"},{"patch":"@@ -0,0 +1,336 @@\n+# Producing a Changeset\n+\n+This section is confined to the actual Mercurial mechanics required to produce a changeset:\n+\n+* [Setting a JDK User Name](#setting-a-jdk-user-name) reminds the user to confirm proper configuration.\n+* [Creating](#creating) includes instructions for the required format of a changeset comment and describes how to commit files to a changeset.\n+* [Merging](#merging) describes how to pull changes from a parent forest or clone and incorporate the changes into the current working set of files.\n+* [Pushing](#pushing) covers configuring ssh, setting the `default-push` path, and pushing changesets.\n+\n+## Setting a JDK User Name\n+\n+Ensure that _ui.username_ has a value in the `~\/.hgrc` file as described in [Verifying the Configuration](#verifying-the-configuration).\n+\n+## Creating\n+\n+The timing for creating a changeset is important. Creating the changeset long before it gets pushed into the parent repository may require complex merges. If a changeset is created before sufficient review or testing, a rollback may be required and a new changeset may be required to correct previous mistakes. The [mq extension](http:\/\/hgbook.red-bean.com\/hgbookch12.html#x16-26500012) is recommended for managing changes before they become committed to a changeset.\n+\n+In the examples below, the script `common\/bin\/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply the Mercurial command to all the repositories in the forest. So when you see _**`hg`**_, if you are dealing with one repository, just use \"`hg`\", if it's a forest, use \"`sh common\/bin\/hgforest.sh`\".\n+\n+\n+Each repository in the forest is managed independently. After editing files in the individual cloned repositories of the forest, the `hg status` command may be used to see the changes in a single repository.\n+\n+    $ hg root\n+    \/u\/iris\/sandbox\/box\n+    $ hg status\n+    ? duke\/images\/DukeTubbingSmall.png\n+    $ hg add duke\/images\/DukeTubbingSmall.png\n+    $ hg status\n+    A duke\/images\/DukeTubbingSmall.png\n+\n+To see changes made to the repositories use _**`hg`**_ `status`:\n+\n+    $ hg status\n+    [.]\n+    A duke\/images\/DukeTubbingSmall.png\n+\n+In this example, the repository was previously cloned as described in [Cloning a Sandbox Repository](#clone).

It's just one line, meant to give the reader a clue as to how the code changed. A more complete description of the change belongs in the bug report.\n+\n+A _reviewed-by_ line is required. Reviewers must have the ability to deal with any adverse consequences of the change, and so must themselves be authors. They are therefore identified by their OpenJDK usernames rather than full e-mail addresses.\n+\n+The _contributed-by_ line is optional. If present, it's a list of comma-separated email addresses. It should be included only when the author or authors of the change don't have commit rights to the target repository and thus would not otherwise receive acknowledgment.\n+\n+There will be exceptions for merge changesets, tag changesets, etc.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+    1234567: NPE thrown on FileInputStream(\"\")\n+    Summary: Rewrite precondition-checking code in io.c\n+    Reviewed-by: mr\n+    Contributed-by: Ben Bitdiddle <ben at bits.org>\n+\n+If a changeset contains multiple unrelated changes (this is frowned upon, but may happen from time to time) then its comment will contain multiple blocks of the above form, separated by blank lines.\n+\n+The required format of the comments will be enforced whenever the changeset is pushed into the JDK master or team repository forests.

The first step in a merge process is to retrieve (or pull) the collection of changesets which have been pushed since the last merge or initial clone. If there if there are merge conflicts, then they must be resolved. [Chapter 3](http:\/\/hgbook.red-bean.com\/hgbookch3.html#x7-530003) of the Mercurial book contains detailed information on the merging process.\n+\n+There are two basic ways to update the working set files in the repositories:\n+\n+Option 1: _**`hg`**_ `pull`\n+\n+> One way to merge the parent repository with the working set of files is to use _**`hg`**_ `pull` all by itself. This option allows merging off-line or at a later time.\n+>\n+>     $ hg pull\n+>     [.]\n+>     pulling from http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/sandbox\/box\n+>     searching for changes\n+>     no changes found\n+>\n+> In Mercurial, pulling changesets will not update or merge into the working set of files. To update the clone, run _**`hg`**_ `update`. If the update reports conflicts, run _**`hg`**_ `merge` to resolve them.\n+\n+Option 2: _**`hg`**_ `fetch`\n+\n+> Alternatively, use _**`hg`**_ `fetch` to pull the changes, update the working set files, and create simple merge changesets as necessary. The fetch extension is distributed with Mercurial but needs to be enabled. Edit the `.hgrc` to include the following entries:\n+>\n+>     [extensions]\n+>     fetch=\n+>\n+> Once the fetch extension has been enabled, _**`hg`**_ `fetch` may be invoked as follows:\n+>\n+>     $ hg fetch\n+>     [.]\n+>     pulling from http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/sandbox\/box\n+>     searching for changes\n+>     no changes found\n+\n+> ---\n+> Actual file merging will be done with the selected Mercurial merging tool see [MergeProgram](https:\/\/www.selenic.com\/mercurial\/wiki\/index.cgi\/MergeProgram) for the details on how to define the selected merge tool in ` ~\/.hgrc`.\n+\n+> ---\n+\n+## Pushing\n+\n+In order to push changesets into the parent repository, some additional configuration is required. The following sections describe the operations that will be performed by users with push access.\n+\n+#### Generating an SSH Key\n+\n+All pushes require an ssh key which must be installed on the Mercurial server. The `ssh-keygen` command generates an ssh key. The `-b` option overrides the default number of bits for the key. Allow a few minutes to generate a 4096 bit key; a key of at least 2048 bits is recommended. While it's possible to use ssh without a passphrase, this is **strongly** discouraged. Empty or insecure passphrases may be reset using `ssh-keygen -p`; this doesn't change the keys.\n+\n+    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096\n+    Enter file in which to save the key(\/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa):\n+    Generating public\/private rsa key pair.\n+    Enter passphrase(empty for no passphrase):\n+    Enter same passphrase again:\n+    Your identification has been saved in \/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa.\n+    Your public key has been saved in \/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub.\n+    The key fingerprint is:\n+    md5 4096 c2:b7:00:e6:4b:da:ea:ec:32:30:f5:bd:12:26:04:83 iris@duke\n+    The key's randomart image is:\n+    +--[ RSA 4096]----+\n+    |    E.=          |\n+    |     . *         |\n+    |      o .   .    |\n+    |         + o     |\n+    |        S + .    |\n+    |       .   + .   |\n+    |        + + +..  |\n+    |       * . oo+.  |\n+    |      o . .o..   |\n+    +-----------------+\n+\n+The `~\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub` is a text file containing the public ssh key. This file should be mailed as an attachment along with the JDK username to [keys(at)openjdk.java.net](mailto:keys-at-openjdk.java.net). An administrator will install your key on the server and notify you on completion. This process may take a couple of days.\n+\n+> ---\n+> Users behind a SOCKS firewall can add a directive to the `~\/.ssh\/config` file to connect to the OpenJDK Mercurial server:\n+>\n+>     Host *.openjdk.java.net\n+>     ProxyCommand \/usr\/lib\/ssh\/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect -h [socks_proxy_address] %h %p\n+>\n+> See the `ssh-socks5-proxy-connect` man page and `ssh-config` man page for more information.

Some Linux distributions provide the `corkscrew` package which provides ssh access through HTTP proxies.\n+>\n+> **It's recommended that all users check with their network administrators before installing any kind of TCP forwarding tool on their network. Many corporations and institutions have strict security policies in this area.**\n+\n+> ---\n+\n+#### SSH Shortcuts\n+\n+The following section provides some tips for improving the usability of ssh-related operations.\n+\n+* _Using SSH in multiple shells_\n+\n+  To avoid having to constantly type in the passphrase, use the ssh-agent on your local client to cache your pashphrase:\n+\n+      $ eval `ssh-agent`\n+      Agent pid 17450\n+      $ ssh-add\n+      Enter passphrase for \/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa:\n+      Identity added: \/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa(\/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa)\n+\n+  The same ssh-agent process can be shared with multiple shells. There are various ways to do this. Bash users can accomplish this with the following code in `.bashrc`:\n+\n+      if [ \"$PS1\" -a -d $HOME\/.ssh ]; then\n+        if [ \"x$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\" = x ]; then\n+          eval `ssh-agent | grep -v 'echo Agent pid'`\n+          ssh-add\n+          trap \"echo Killing SSH agent $SSH_AGENT_PID; kill $SSH_AGENT_PID\" 0\n+        fi\n+      fi\n+\n+  For secure operation, only start an ssh-agent when needed and kill it off when the shell completes. Test this by running `ssh 'hostname' echo hello` multiple times.\n+\n+* _Logging in without a password_\n+\n+  To avoid needing to constantly type in the password, add the public key to the list of ssh authorized keys.\n+\n+      $ cat ~\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub >> ~\/.ssh\/authorized_keys\n+      $ chmod 600 ~\/.ssh\/authorized_keys\n+\n+#### Setting the `default-push` Path to the Server Repositories\n+\n+<!--\n+#. Option 1: Add default-push path to every <code>.hg\/hgrc<\/code>\n+-->\n+\n+This is the typical development model:\n+\n+::: {style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n+~~~{.mermaid caption=\"Diagram of server repos and user's clone\" format=svg theme=neutral}\n+graph TD\n+    subgraph hg.openjdk.java.net\n+        origin(jdk9\/dev)\n+    end\n+    origin --> |clone| local(9dev)\n+    local --> |push| origin\n+~~~\n+:::\n+\n+Changesets need to be _pushed_ via ssh to the read\/write repository which resides on the OpenJDK Mercurial server. The easiest way to do this is to have each repository define the \"default-push\" path in every repository's `.hg\/hgrc` file. The `.hg\/hgrc` file in isn't a managed file - it's private to the repository. The following example defines the \"default\" and \"default-push\" paths for clones of the jdk9\/dev team repository.\n+\n+    [paths]\n+    default = http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/jdk9\/dev\n+    default-push = ssh:\/\/<JDK_username>@hg.openjdk.java.net\/jdk9\/dev\n+\n+Given a `JDK_username` this simple script will attempt to do this for all the repositories:\n+\n+    #!\/bin\/sh\n+    username=$1\n+    hgdirs=\"`find . -type d -name .hg`\"\n+    for i in ${hgdirs}; do\n+      d=\"`dirname ${i}`\"\n+      defpush=\"`(cd ${d} && hg paths default-push 2> \/dev\/null)`\"\n+      if [ \"${defpush}\" = \"\" ] ; then\n+        defpath=\"`(cd ${d} && hg paths default 2> \/dev\/null)`\"\n+        if [ \"${defpath}\" != \"\" ] ; then\n+          defpush=\"`echo ${defpath} | sed -e 's@http:\/\/\\([^\/]*\/[^\/]*\/[^\/]*\\)\/\\(.*\\)@ssh:\/\/$username\\@\\1\/\\2@'`\"\n+          cp ${i}\/hgrc ${i}\/hgrc.orig\n+          echo \"default-push = ${defpush}\" >> ${i}\/hgrc\n+          echo \"Added default-push: ${defpush}\"\n+        fi\n+      fi\n+    done\n+    for i in ${hgdirs}; do\n+      d=\"`dirname ${i}`\"\n+      echo \"(cd ${d} && hg paths)\"\n+      (cd ${d} && hg paths)\n+    done\n+    exit 0\n+\n+<!--\n+#. Option 2: Use the <code>defpath<\/code> ExtensionAnother way to setup the default-push path is to use the Mercurial defpath extension, which is available in \/java\/jdk\/lib\/hgext\/defpath.py. To enable this extension add the following to the <code>~\/hgrc<\/code> file:\n+<blockquote><pre>\n+[extensions]\n+defpath = \/java\/jdk\/lib\/hgext\/defpath.py  # Or the pathname of a local copy\n+<\/pre><\/blockquote>\n+     The defpath extension actually adds two new Mercurial subcommands:\n+    defpath to operate upon a single repository and fdefpath for an entire\n+    forest. hg help defpath or hg help fdefpath will tell you more. For a\n+    freshly cloned open\/closed forest the command you probably want is\n+<blockquote><pre>\n+$ hg fdefpath -dgv\n+<\/pre><\/blockquote>\n+     Be sure to try this with the -n flag first to see if it will do what\n+    you actually expect. If your OpenJDK username differs from your Oracle\n+    username then add -u name to the command line.\n+     The defpath extension defines the default-push path, which is the path\n+    that Mercurial uses by default in push operations.\n+-->\n+\n+#### Pushing a Changeset\n+\n+[Committers](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#committer) can use the _**hg**_ `push` command to propagate changesets into the repositories.\n+\n+Most developers will only find a need to create changesets in one or two repositories. However, it's important that before any changesets are pushed, the corresponding forest pull and merge with the destination forest be performed; otherwise there is a risk of breaking the build.\n+\n+    $ hg push\n+\n+After the push has been accepted, an automatic e-mail notification will be sent to the [mailing list](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net) associated with the repository. In most cases notifications are sent to the Project's _-dev_ mailing list. Some Projects with high traffic _-dev_ mailing lists use a dedicated _-changes_ list for notifications.\n+\n+> ---\n+> Who has push access?\n+>\n+> All of a Project's [Committers](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#committer) can push to all of the the Project's repositories.\n+>\n+> Some Projects may chose to restrict the set of Committers with push to key repositories. For instance, JDK Release Projects restrict push access to MASTER repositories to Committers who are either integrators or members of the Release Engineering Team.\n+>\n+> Refer to the [Nominating a Contributor or Author to be a Committer](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/index.html#project-committer) section of the [Project](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/index.html) page for information about becoming a Project Committer.\n+\n+> ---\n+\n+## Backing Out a Change\n+\n+If a change causes a regression that can't be fixed within reasonable time the best way to handle the regression can be to back out the change. Backing out means that the inverse (anti-delta) of the change is pushed to effectively undo the change in the repository. There are two parts to this task, how to do the bookkeeping in JBS, and how to do the actual backout in mercurial.\n+\n+The backout is a regular change and will have to go through the standard code review process, but is considered a [trivial](#trivial) change. The rationale is that a backout is usually urgent in nature and the change itself is automatically created by hg, and reviewed by the person who is performing the backout, so even though only one additional Reviewer is required the change will in practice get two reviews.\n+\n+### How to work with JBS when a change is backed out\n+\n+#. Close the original JBS issue **(O)**.\n+   * \"Verify\" the issue and choose \"Fix Failed\".\n+#. If the intention is to fix the change and submit it again, create a redo-issue **(R)** to track that the work still needs to be done.\n+   * Clone **(O)** and add the prefix `[REDO]` on the summary - the clone becomes the redo-issue **(R)**.\n+   * Make sure relevant information is brought to **(R)**.\n+   * Remember that comments aren't brought over when cloning.\n+#. Create a backout-issue **(B)**:\n+   * Alternative 1 - the regression is identified directly.\n+     * Create a sub-task to **(R)** with the same summary, prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.\n+   * Alternative 2 - an investigation issue is created **(I)**, and during the investigation backing out the change is identified as the best solution.\n+     * Use the investigation issue **(I)** for the backout.\n+     * Change summary of **(I)** to the same as **(O)** and prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.\n+     * Move and change type of **(I)** to become a sub-task of **(R)**.\n+   * Alternative 3 - no redo issue was created.\n+     * Create a backout-issue **(B)** with the same summary as **(O)**, prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.\n+     * Link **(B)** and **(O)**.\n+\n+ProblemList entries and `@ignore` keywords will continue to point to the original bug (unless updated at back out). This is accepted since there is a clone link to follow.\n+\n+### How to work with mercurial when a change is backed out\n+\n+In order to backout a change, the `hg backout` command is recommended, which essentially applies the anti delta of the change.

It was created in November 2006, when initial portions of the JDK source code were published under the GPLv2 license.\n-\n-In order to work together efficiently, clear directions are sometimes needed to avoid misconceptions and to align developers' views of terminology and process. The OpenJDK Community is a fairly pragmatic place. \"Do the right thing\" is most often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way then everyone's work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the recommended ways to do things.\n-\n-The goal of this guide is to answer questions that developers of the JDK might have around development process, tooling, standards, and so forth. The formal rules and processes are described in other documents, such as [JEP 1](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jeps\/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal & Roadmap Process, and [JEP 3](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jeps\/3) for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement to such documents, with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest of the OpenJDK Community.\n-\n-There are many common use cases that aren't detailed in the formal process. This guide suggests how to work in such cases.\n-\n-## I have a patch, what do I do?\n-\n-::: {.box}\n-[Quick Links]{.boxheader}\n-\n-* [Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA)](https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technical-resources\/oracle-contributor-agreement.html)\n-* [JDK Bug System (JBS)](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/)\n-* [OpenJDK Project Roles](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project-roles)\n-:::\n-\n-In many GitHub projects the standard way to propose a change is to create a pull request (PR) and discuss the patch in the PR. For OpenJDK projects the situation is somewhat different. The JDK is used for mission critical applications and by millions of developers, the bar to contributing changes is high. Please follow the steps outlined below to make sure your change passes above the bar before creating a PR.\n-\n-### 1. Sign the OCA\n-\n-Oracle is the steward of the OpenJDK project. In order to make your patch available for review you must first sign the [Oracle Contributor Agreement](https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technical-resources\/oracle-contributor-agreement.html) (OCA). This agreement gives Oracle and you as a contributor joint copyright interests in the code. You will retain your copyright while also granting those rights to Oracle.\n-\n-When you sign the OCA, please make sure that you specify your GitHub user name in the `Username` field of the OCA. If you try to create a PR before you have signed the OCA, or if you didn't specify your GitHub user name, you'll get instructions telling you to do so, and the PR won't be published until this is done. OCA registration is a manual process. Please allow for up to several days to have your OCA application processed, even though it's normally processed swiftly.\n-\n-### 2. Socialize your change\n-\n-Once the OCA is signed, please restrain your urge to create a PR just a little while longer. In order to prepare the community for your patch, please socialize your idea on the relevant [mailing lists](#mailing-lists). Almost all changes, and in particular any API changes, must go this route and have a broad agreement in place before there is any point in presenting code. To understand the criteria by which your patch is going to be judged, please read [_Why is My Change Rejected?_](#why-is-my-change-rejected) below. In short, hidden constraints and assumptions, stability and quality, maintainability, compatibility, and conformance to specifications must be considered before your PR is ready to be submitted. If you don't understand the constraints for acceptance, you might be surprised when your PR is rejected.\n-\n-### 3. Find a sponsor\n-\n-Socializing your change on the mailing lists also prevents the surprise that would otherwise make the community choke on their morning coffee when they see a huge patch in a new, unknown PR. As a new developer in the community you'll need to make a few friends that agree with your change. There are many good reasons to make friends, but the one relevant here is that for your first changes you'll need a sponsor to facilitate the integration of your work. The sponsor will perform any number of administrative tasks like JBS updates, additional testing, etc. It's usual for a sponsor to also be a reviewer of a change and thus familiar with it, but it's not a requirement.\n-\n-### 4. Create a tracking issue in JBS\n-\n-Many OpenJDK projects require a tracking issue to be filed in the [JDK Bug System (JBS)](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/) before a change can be pushed. This is the case for instance for the JDK and the JDK-Updates projects. In order to get write access to JBS you need to be an [Author](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#author) in an OpenJDK project. For your first changes, ask your sponsor to help you create the issue.\n-\n-If you continue to contribute high-quality content you'll soon enough be eligible for OpenJDK roles in the project. First Author, and later Committer. The Committer role means you won't need a sponsor anymore. You can read more about [OpenJDK Project Roles](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project-roles).\n-\n-### 5. Get acquainted with local process\n-\n-Even though we strive to unify how things are done within the OpenJDK, different areas and projects in the OpenJDK may have slight variations in how they work. Some of these differences are highlighted throughout this guide, some aren't. If you're new to an area, make sure you understand local differences before you proceed. Ask your sponsor who should be your main point of contact through your first developer experience in the OpenJDK.\n-\n-## Why is my change rejected?\n-\n-::: {.box}\n-[Quick Links]{.boxheader}\n-\n-* [Java Language and Virtual Machine Specifications](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/specs\/)\n-* [Java API Specification](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/en\/java\/javase\/15\/docs\/api\/index.html)\n-* [CSR Process](https:\/\/wiki.openjdk.java.net\/display\/csr\/Main)\n-:::\n-\n-Java and the JDK are very popular products, and just about every Java developer out there has an idea or two for how to enhance something. And (obviously not referring to you) believe it or not, not every idea is a good idea. Even though many ideas are indeed good, we must be quite restrictive on what we actually include into the JDK. There are many reasons for this.\n-\n-* **Hidden constraints and assumptions**. Many sections of code have constraints and assumptions that aren't necessarily visible at first glance. This might preclude certain changes, even those that might seem obvious.\n-\n-* **Stability and quality**. The JDK is used by millions of developers and as a widely deployed commercial product, it's held to a high standard of quality. Changes should include tests where practical, and core tests should pass at all times. The value of the change should outweigh the risk of introducing a bug or performance regression.\n-\n-* **Maintainability**. Any new feature or code change will need to be maintained in the JDK essentially forever, thus imposing a maintenance burden on future maintainers. The code might still be in use long after you and the people who reviewed it have moved on. New maintainers must be able to understand how to fix bugs in this code.\n-\n-* **Complexity**. Each new feature interacts with all the existing features, which can result in geometric growth of the interactions among features if features are added unchecked. Sometimes we avoid adding a new feature, even if it seems like an obvious thing to add, if that feature would make it difficult to add a more important feature in the future.\n-\n-* **Adherence to specifications**. Much of the JDK is governed by a series of specifications, in particular the [Java Language Specification](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/specs\/), the [Java Virtual Machine Specification](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/specs\/), and the [Java API Specification](https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/en\/java\/javase\/15\/docs\/api\/index.html) (\"javadocs\"). All changes must be checked and tested carefully to ensure that they don't violate these specifications.\n-\n-* **Javadoc comments are specifications**. The Java API Specification is authored in the form of javadoc comments, so even apparently innocuous changes to comments can be quite significant. It's not always easy to tell what comments are part of the specification and what parts are merely code comments. Briefly, documentation comments on public packages, classes, and class members of exported modules are specifications.\n-\n-* **Specification changes**. It's possible to change the API specifications, and this is done regularly. However, these changes require even more scrutiny than code changes. This extra review is handled by the [CSR Process](https:\/\/wiki.openjdk.java.net\/display\/csr\/Main). Specifications are written in stylized, somewhat formal language, and they don't simply describe what the code does. Writing specifications is a separate skill from coding.\n-\n-* **Compatibility**. Changes should also adhere to high standards of binary, source, and behavioral compatibility. The compatibility impact of apparently innocuous changes is sometimes startling.\n-\n-For reasons like these it’s quite possible that your change, even though it adds value to you, isn’t deemed to add enough value to the larger community.\n-\n-# Mailing Lists\n-\n-::: {.box}\n-[Quick Links]{.boxheader}\n-\n-* [OpenJDK Mailing Lists Manager](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net\/mailman\/listinfo)\n-:::\n-\n-The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work. All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the relevant mailing list. A subscriber to an OpenJDK mailing list is referred to as a [Participant](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#participant) in the [Bylaws](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws). As a general recommendation we suggest to subscribe to [announce](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net\/mailman\/listinfo\/announce), [discuss](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net\/mailman\/listinfo\/discuss), and the `-dev` lists covering your explicit area of interest. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:\n-\n-> [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net\/mailman\/listinfo)\n-\n-The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it's important to keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global. Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists. Even though English is the required language for all lists, many Participants speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect English is expected from anyone joining these lists. You're also strongly encouraged to use your real name on the mailing lists. This adds to the professional tone of your email. Postings from anonymized mailboxes risk being seen as spam. If you do work in the OpenJDK on behalf of your employer, please also list this affiliation. If your GitHub username differs from your real name it's also a good idea to include that to identify yourself and your actions on GitHub.\n-\n-You must be a member of a list to be able to post to that list. Some lists are moderated to keep the content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older conversations on the list.\n-\n-There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what the list is intended for, `<name>-<suffix>`. The name often refers to the project that owns the list or a specific area of interest that the list focuses on. The suffix is explained below. Not all projects or areas have all types of lists described here.\n-\n-> `-dev`\n-> :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This is also where code reviews happen.\n-\n-> `-use`\n-> :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.\n-\n-> `-discuss`\n-> :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss(at)openjdk.java.net` is used for general discussions around the OpenJDK project. Discussions around new project proposals usually happens here.\n-\n->  `-changes`\n-> :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.\n-\n-> `-announce`\n-> :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net` is used for announcements for the OpenJDK project.\n-\n-> `-experts`\n-> :    Expert group discussions. The list is restricted; only members of the expert group can subscribe.\n-\n-> `-observers`\n-> :    Open for anyone to subscribe to see what the experts are discussing and potentially to have some dialog with other non-experts. There is no guarantee that an expert is subscribed to the `-observers` list or will see any responses on that list.\n-\n-> `-comments`\n-> :    Used by observers to directly provide feedback\/comments to the experts (typically a lead will process the comments list and forward things on to the experts list).\n-\n-## Changing your email address\n-\n-If you need to change your registered email address, or if you have any other problems with the mailing lists, please contact [mailman@openjdk.java.net](mailto:mailman@openjdk.java.net).\n-\n-# Repositories\n-\n-This section describes the OpenJDK repository terminology and naming scheme. It also includes minimal instructions to acquire source from the OpenJDK repository, [`https:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/`](https:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/).\n-\n-> ---\n-> Note that source may be available from other locations, for example `src.zip` from a full JDK distribution. However, OpenJDK contributions must use source from the [OpenJDK Mercurial repository](https:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/) since other source distributions may contain older code or code which differs due to licensing.\n-\n-> ---\n-\n-Operations which are performed repeatedly, such as creating changesets, merging, and pushing are described in [Producing a Changeset](#producing-a-changeset).\n-\n-* [Terminology and Naming Scheme](#terminology-and-naming-scheme) defines the nomenclature used by OpenJDK.\n-* [Installing and Configuring Mercurial](#installing-and-configuring) enumerates the required software, provides links for download, and describes basic installation and configuration.\n-* [Cloning](#clone) covers the procedure for obtaining private copies of source repositories.\n-\n-This document assumes familiarity with the first two chapters of the free on-line book [Mercurial: The Definitive Guide](http:\/\/hgbook.red-bean.com).\n-\n-## Terminology and Naming Scheme\n-\n-The OpenJDK code base for all [Projects](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project) is stored in Mercurial repositories which contain the source files and their change history. Some Projects may choose to organize their code into multiple, possibly related, Mercurial repositories. For instance, [JDK 9](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/jdk9) uses a forest of multiple related repositories which contain components of the entire JDK. Projects which are based on the JDK, such as [IcedTea](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/icedtea) and [Jigsaw](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/jigsaw) also use this model. In contrast, [Code Tools](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/code-tools) uses an unrelated repository for each tool and [Graal](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/graal) uses only a single repository. Regardless of how a Project has chosen to store their code, each [Contributor](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#contributor) clones the repository associated with the code they are modifying.\n-\n-> ---\n-> Consult the Project's documentation or [mailing list](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net) to determine the appropriate repository, development conventions, and helpful tools.\n-\n-> ---\n-\n-This is the typical development model:\n-\n-::: {style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n-~~~{.mermaid caption=\"Diagram of server repos and user's clone\" format=svg theme=neutral}\n-graph TD\n-    subgraph hg.openjdk.java.net\n-        origin(jdk9\/dev)\n-    end\n-    origin --> |clone| local(9dev)\n-    local --> |push| origin\n-~~~\n-:::\n-\n-A Contributor creates a _clone_ (a local copy called \"9dev\") of a read\/write repository (\"jdk9\/dev\") which resides on the OpenJDK Mercurial server. They work on their change in the clone and locally _commit_ a changeset. After the new changeset(s) are verified, they're either _pushed_ directly from the clone or _exported_ and delivered to a [Committer](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#committer) who can perform the push into the server repository for all to see.\n-\n-> ---\n-> The use of _gate repositories_ was eliminated when the Mercurial servers were upgraded in March 2014.\n-\n-> ---\n-\n-The repositories use the following naming scheme:\n-\n-> `<project>\/<component_path>`\n-\n-where\n-\n-> ------------------  ----  ----------------------------------------------------\n-> _project_            ::   the short name of an OpenJDK [Project](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project) such as \"jdk9\", \"openjfx\", or \"sumatra\"\n-> _component_path_     ::   the path to a repository containing the code base as designated by the [Project Lead](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project-lead).\n-> ------------------  ----  ----------------------------------------------------\n-\n-## Installing and Configuring Mercurial\n-\n-Mercurial is a free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source bundles and binary packages for Mercurial are available at [https:\/\/www.selenic.com\/mercurial\/wiki\/index.cgi](https:\/\/www.selenic.com\/mercurial\/wiki\/index.cgi\/Mercurial). The OpenJDK repositories recommend installation of Mercurial 2.6.3 (or later). A Mercurial installation is sufficient to clone a repository. Contributors who wish to submit changes will need some additional configuration as described below.\n-\n-Some Projects may recommend additional tools or scripts that help with repository manipulation and code development. For instance, in JDK 9, the utility script `common\/bin\/hgforest.sh` may be used to apply commands to all the repositories in the [forest](#forest). Popular extensions for OpenJDK developers include [jcheck](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/code-tools\/jcheck\/), [trees](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/code-tools\/trees\/), and [Mercurial Queues](http:\/\/hgbook.red-bean.com\/read\/managing-change-with-mercurial-queues.html) (mq). Note that `trees` is enabled on the OpenJDK Mercurial server.\n-\n-Create and edit the `~\/.hgrc` file to minimally contain the following entry:\n-\n-    [ui]\n-    username = <openjdk_username>\n-\n-_openjdk\\_username_ is a plain lowercase, alphanumeric token (not an e-mail address) with twelve characters or less. The first character should be alphabetic. This username will be publicly visible in all Mercurial changeset logs. It will be used to verify that the changeset author is at least an [Author](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#author) for the Project and that the person pushing the changeset is at least a [Committer](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#committer). It's recommended that the _openjdk\\_username_ be somehow related to the Author's full name, such as the first character of the Author's first name followed by the Author's last name. Refer to the [Becoming an Author](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/index.html#project-author) section of the [Project](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/index.html) page for additional information.\n-\n-An alphabetical list of all of the assigned _openjdk\\_usernames_ may be found on the [OpenJDK people](https:\/\/db.openjdk.java.net\/people) list. The [Census](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/census) shows the structure of the OpenJDK Community.\n-\n-#### Verifying the Configuration\n-\n-After installing and configuring Mercurial, validate the configuration using the following steps.\n-\n-#. Verify that Mercurial is version 2.6.3 (or newer).\n-\n-       $ hg version\n-       Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 2.9)\n-       (see http:\/\/mercurial.selenic.com for more information)\n-\n-       Copyright (C) 2005-2014 Matt Mackall and others\n-       This is free software; see the source for copying conditions. There is NO\n-       warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n-\n-#. Verify that the list of enabled extensions includes fetch and mq.\n-\n-       $ hg help\n-\n-#. Verify that the `~\/.hgrc` configuration looks correct. Minimally it should contain the following entries:\n-\n-       $ hg showconfig\n-       ui.username=iris\n-\n-At this point, it should be possible to start retrieving source from the repositories.\n-\n-## Cloning\n-\n-With Mercurial each developer works with a clone of the repository which is a snapshot of the files at the time the clone was taken. To update the clone, see [Producing a Changeset](#producing-a-changeset).\n-\n-#### ... a Sandbox Repository {#cloneSandbox}\n-\n-In addition to the Project repositories, there are some test repositories that may be used to run test commands against Mercurial without fear of causing damage to development source. Use them freely but with discretion; content in them may be deleted at any time.\n-\n-    $ mkdir sandbox; cd sandbox\n-    $ hg clone http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/sandbox\/box\n-    destination directory: box\n-    requesting all changes\n-    adding changesets\n-    adding manifests\n-    adding file changes\n-    added 23 changesets with 24 changes to 5 files\n-    4 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved\n-    $ du -s box\n-    46      box\n-\n-#### ... a Forest {#cloneForest}\n-\n-If a Project uses a forest, It's strongly recommended for developers to clone an entire forest, rather than a single repository. This is the only means to ensure consistency in builds. The following examples illustrate two alternatives for cloning the entire _jdk9\/dev_ forest into the directory `9dev`.\n-\n-#. To clone the forest using the [trees](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/code-tools\/trees\/) extension just use `tclone`:\n-\n-       $ hg tclone http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/jdk9\/dev 9dev\n-\n-#. To clone the forest using `get_source.sh`, first clone the main tree:\n-\n-       $ hg clone http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/jdk9\/dev 9dev\n-       requesting all changes\n-       adding changesets\n-       adding manifests\n-       adding file changes\n-       added 997 changesets with 1477 changes to 138 files\n-       updating to branch default\n-       82 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved\n-\n-   Then clone the repositories in the forest:\n-\n-       $ cd 9dev\n-       $ sh .\/get_source.sh\n-\n-Regardless of how the forest was cloned, this is the resulting populated forest.\n-\n-    $ du -s\n-    934532  .\n-    $ ls\n-    ASSEMBLY_EXCEPTION  hotspot    LICENSE   README-builds.html\n-    common              jaxp       make      test\n-    configure           jaxws      Makefile  THIRD_PARTY_README\n-    corba               jdk        nashorn\n-    get_source.sh       langtools  README\n-\n-#### ... a Single Repository {#cloneSingle}\n-\n-If the source for the Project is contained within a single repository or reading a limited portion of the source is the only goal, it's possible to clone a single repository (even if it's part of a forest). For instance, this example shows how to clone the `langtools` repository from _jdk9\/dev_ into the default destination directory.\n-\n-    $ hg clone http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/jdk9\/dev\/langtools\n-    destination directory: langtools\n-    requesting all changes\n-    adding changesets\n-    adding manifests\n-    adding file changes\n-    added 2289 changesets with 21194 changes to 7004 files\n-    updating to branch default\n-    6212 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved\n-    $ du -s langtools\n-    84396   langtools\n-\n-# Code Conventions\n-\n-::: {.box}\n-[Quick Links]{.boxheader}\n-\n-* [Java Code Conventions](https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/java\/codeconvtoc-136057.html)\n-* [HotSpot C++ Code Conventions](https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/doc\/hotspot-style.md)\n-:::\n-\n-# JBS - JDK Bug System\n-\n-::: {.box}\n-[Quick Links]{.boxheader}\n-\n-* [Bug Report Tool](https:\/\/bugreport.java.com\/)\n-* [JDK Bug System (JBS)](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/)\n-:::\n-\n-[JBS](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/) is an issue tracker used by many OpenJDK projects.\n-\n-## Filing a Bug\n-\n-When a new failure is found in the JDK a bug should be filed to describe and track the issue. Depending on your role in the OpenJDK you can either use the [Bug Report Tool](https:\/\/bugreport.java.com\/) or, if you are [Author](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#author) in an OpenJDK [Project](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#project), report the bug directly in the [JDK Bug System](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/). Try to make the bug report as complete as possible to make it easier to triage and investigate the bug.\n-\n-It's not the reporter's responsibility to set a correct priority, but a qualified guess is always better than a default value. To help with setting the right priority consider things like how the bug impacts the product and our testing, how likely is it that the bug triggers, how difficult is it to work around the bug if it's not fixed soon, and whether it's a recent regression, since that may break existing applications. Regressions are often higher priority than long standing bugs and may block a release if not fixed.\n-\n-A few things to keep in mind when filing a new bug:\n-\n-* Before filing a bug, verify that there isn't already a bug filed for this issue.\n-* If you suspect that the bug is a vulnerability, don't file a JBS issue. Instead send your bugreport to [vuln-dev@openjdk.java.net](mailto:vuln-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-* Make a reasonable attempt to narrow down which build or release the failure first appeared in.\n-* Add relevant labels like [`intermittent`](#intermittent), [`regression`](#regression), [`noreg-self`](#noreg-self), ['tier1'](#tier) etc.\n-* Set affects version to the JDK version(s) where the failure was seen.\n-  * If the failure is found in an update train of the JDK (e.g. 11.0.x), please make an effort to see if the bug is also present in [mainline](https:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/jdk\/jdk\/).\n-* Set priority (see above)\n-* In the description, always include (if possible):\n-  * full name of the failing tests\n-  * error messages\n-  * assert messages\n-  * stack trace\n-  * command line information\n-  * relevant information from the logs\n-* If the failure isn't reproducible with an existing OpenJDK test, attach a reproducer if possible.\n-* Only set CPU and\/or OS fields if the bug **ONLY** happens on that particular platform.\n-* Always file separate bugs for different issues.\n-  * If two crashes looks related but not similar enough to for sure be the same, it's easier to close a bug as a duplicate than it is to extract the relevant info from a bug to create a new one later.\n-\n-To find out which component to use for different bugs, consult the [directory to area mapping](#directory-to-area-mapping).\n-\n-## How to fix an incorrect backport creation\n-\n-If a main bug is targeted to a release and the fix is pushed to a different release, then a backport bug is automatically created. Usually this is a \"good thing\", e.g., when you are backporting a fix to an earlier release, but not always... If the main bug is targeted to a later release (due to schedule planning), but someone finds the time to fix that bug in the current release, then the bug should be retargeted to the current release before pushing the fix. However, sometimes we forget to do that.\n-\n-Here is how to fix that:\n-\n-> ---\n-> In this example a fix was pushed to JDK N (a.k.a. the current release) while the JBS bug was targeted to JDK N+1 (a.k.a. a future release).\n-\n-> ---\n-\n-#. Reopen the _backport_ bug that was created automatically\n-   * Use a comment like the following (in the reopen dialog):\n-~~~\n-Fix was pushed while main bug was targeted to 'N+1'. Reset the main bug to fixed in 'N', reset this bug to fix in 'N+1' and closed as 'Not An Issue' since JDK N+1 will automatically get this fix from JDK N.\n-~~~\n-   * Change the 'Fix Version\/s' from 'N' to 'N+1'.\n-   * Close the _backport_ bug as \"Not an Issue\".\n-#. Clean up the _main_ bug\n-   * Copy the open push notification comment from the _backport_ bug to the _main_ bug, e.g.:\n-~~~\n-Changeset: 12345678\n-Author: Duke <duke@openjdk.org>\n-Date: 2020-10-23 15:37:46 +0000\n-URL: https:\/\/git.openjdk.java.net\/jdk\/commit\/12345678\n-~~~\n-   * Add a comment like the following to the _main_ bug:\n-~~~\n-Fix was pushed while main bug was targeted to 'N+1'. Reset the main bug to fixed in 'N' and copied the Robo Duke entry here.\n-~~~\n-   * Reset the _main_ bug 'Fix Version\/s' from 'N+1' to 'N'.\n-   * Resolve the _main_ bug as \"Fixed\" in build \"team\" or in build \"master\" depending on where the fix was pushed. Pushes to 'openjdk\/jdk' are fixed in build \"master\" and pushes to project repositories are fixed in build \"team\".\n-\n-## Resolved - Incomplete\n-\n-To resolve an issue as `Incomplete` is JBS lingo for \"Need More Information\". An issue that is `Resolved - Incomplete` is *not* closed but more information is needed to be able to work on it. If no more information is obtained within reasonable time the issue should be closed (`Closed - Incomplete`). Closing a resolved issue is done using the `Verify` option.\n-\n-## JBS Label Dictionary\n-\n-This table contains some frequently used JBS labels and their meaning. Please help keeping this dictionary up to date by adding your favorite labels. This table doesn’t dictate how to use labels, but rather document how they are used. That said, obviously it will help everyone if we try to follow a common standard and use similar labels in the same way across all entities that use JBS.\n-\n-Labels are an open namespace, which means that anyone can create new labels at any time. In order to avoid confusion, however, it's best to reuse existing labels where possible. This can be done by editing the \"labels\" field of a bug and entering the first few characters of the label you want to add. JIRA will pop up an autocomplete window with existing labels that match that prefix. Then choose one of the existing labels. Using the autocomplete window is preferable to typing the whole label name (even if you're a good typist) because it's easy for minor spelling errors to creep in, which can inadvertently introduce multiple labels with spurious spelling variations.\n-\n-> ---\n-> ### Labels are case sensitive\n-> When using labels in Jira gadgets (like pie charts, heat maps, and statistics tables) Jira will be case sensitive and treat e.g. OpenJDK and openjdk as two different labels. Searching however is case insensitive. This means that if you group a set of issues in a gadget based on a label, and then click one of the groups to see the list of issues, that list will contain more results than the gadget if there are usages of the label with different casing. This can be very confusing and for this reason the recommendation is to stick with the commonly used case for all labels, regardless of your personal taste for upper or lower case letters. Most labels are lower case only, but there are examples where upper case letters are used in the most common version of a label. Use of the autocomplete popup window (described above) when adding labels will avoid inadvertent introduction of labels with differing case.\n-\n-> ---\n-\n-<table class=\"dictionary\">\n-  <tr style=\"text-align:left;\"><th>Label<\/th><th>Description<\/th><\/tr>\n-  <tr>\n-    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n-      [*(Area)***`-interest`**]{#area-interest}\n-    <\/td>\n-    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n-      Used to indicate that an area (usually a team or project) is interested in the issue.

The exact reason for the intermittent failure is per definition unknown. Once the reason has been identified the issue is no more considered intermittent. An issue isn't intermittent if some characteristics has been found that triggers the failure consistently, even if the actual cause for the failure hasn't been found. For instance if a test fails every time it's executed on a specific host but not on other hosts it wouldn't be considered intermittent as it fails consistently on that specific host. In other cases it may be that we know that a test sometimes is unlucky in some respect and fails due to this. This test could still be considered intermittent even though we know what the reason is if the reason itself appears intermittently.\n-\n-      Some issues may seem intermittent when looking at test results, even though the reason for failing is actually known. One example is where a test fails consistently on a specific host, or due to specific conditions in the environment. These failures shouldn't be considered intermittent but it may still be valuable to tag these in JBS with one of the labels **`intermittent-hardware`** or **`intermittent-environment`**. This will help to faster identify that the cause of the failure is known without having to read through the entire bug.\n-\n-      A test that should be platform agnostic but is consistently failing on a specific OS would for instance be labeled with **`intermittent-environment`**, while a test that fails every time it's run on some specific hardware would be labeled with **`intermittent-hardware`**.\n-    <\/td>\n-  <\/tr>\n-  <tr>\n-    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n-      [**`maintainer-pain`**]{#maintainer-pain}\n-    <\/td>\n-    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n-Used to tag bugs that for some reason is wasting time or in other ways are causing pain for the OpenJDK maintainers. Examples of issues that could be considered a pain:\n-\n-* A bug that occurs frequently in testing, maybe on a specific platform, maybe specific to one vendor's test infrastructure, and requires that many maintainers investigate the failure in different test runs just to realize it's the same issue as has been seen and reported before, or worse, don't realize it's a known issue and file a duplicate bug in JBS.\n-\n-* Bugs that cause tests to fail without a proper explanation causing several maintainers to investigate the failures just to realize there is no information to be found.\n-\n-* An underlying bug that causes several tests to fail intermittently.\n-\n-* A bug that causes a test failure in a faraway place and the failure isn’t acted on quickly.\n-\n-There are other cases as well and there is some flexibility in the definition. If you see a problem that is causing pain for a large number of maintainers, add an explanation in the JBS issue to why you think the issue is a pain and add the label.\n-\n-If you have a **`maintainer-pain`** bug assigned to you please consider fixing it asap. If you chose not to work on the issue, you should at least be aware that you are choosing to waste others' time and people will be affected by this choice.\n-\n-As with any issue the best way to deal with a **`maintainer-pain`** issue is to fix it. Another way to reduce the noise is to [exclude the failing test](#excluding-a-test). This is a viable option if there is a limited set of tests that are failing and the bug is actively investigated. When excluding a **`maintainer-pain`** issue, remember to move the **`maintainer-pain`** label to the JBS issue used to exclude. Leaving the label on the closed exclude-issue is helpful for tracking purposes.\n-    <\/td>\n-  <\/tr>\n-  <tr>\n-    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n-      [**`noreg-`**`.*`]{#noreg}<br \/>\n-      [**`nounit-`**`.*`]{#nounit}\n-    <\/td>\n-    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n-      The **`noreg-`**`.*` and **`nounit-`**`.*` labels are used to explain why a bugfix doesn't need\/have a regression test or a unit test.

Small bugs include typos in code or specification, algorithm improvements for correctness or performance, and code changes required to correctly implement the specification.\n-\n-> ---\n-> Some steps refer to operations which can't be performed directly without the assistance of a [Project Committer](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#committer). For example, any changes to the [bug database](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net) fall into this category. Since these steps are required, [Contributors](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#contributor) are urged to work with their [Sponsors](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/sponsor\/) to complete these tasks.\n-\n-> ---\n-\n-For the purposes of brevity this document will use the term \"bug\" to refer to both bugs and enhancements unless otherwise noted. Hence \"fix for a bug\" could also imply \"implementation for an enhancement\".\n-\n-#. **Discuss the intended change**\n-\n-   Send an e-mail to the appropriate development mailing list for the Project that maintains the code. The e-mail should have a subject line of the form:\n-\n-       6543210: My favorite bug\n-\n-   where `6543210` is replaced with the actual bug id number or \"[NEW BUG]\" if the bug id isn't known and `My favorite bug` is replaced with the bug's summary.  The message should describe the intended change, which components may be affected, and any other risks or concerns.\n-\n-#. **Does a bug id exist for the work?**\n-\n-   **Yes**\n-   :   Continue\n-\n-   **No**\n-   :   Create a bug in an appropriate component\/sub-component.\n-\n-#. **Set the bug status to \"Open\"**\n-\n-   This communicates intent to fix the bug to other members of the Project. It also sets the expectation for downstream teams such as SQE and JCK that the bug will be fixed in an upcoming integration.\n-\n-#. **Does the fix for the bug require a specification change, directly affect an external interface, or otherwise have a compatibility impact?**\n-\n-   **Yes**\n-   :   Submission of a CSR request is required. The CSR must be [approved](#approved) before the bug fix is pushed to a feature release or update release repository. The work may begin concurrently with the CSR review, but may need to be modified in response to CSR feedback.\n-\n-   **No**\n-   :   Continue\n-\n-#. **Fix the bug**\n-\n-   Assuming that the development team approves of the intended approach, begin working on the code using the latest source available from the appropriate OpenJDK Project [repository](https:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net).\n-\n-#. [**Is it possible to write a test to detect the bug?**]\n-\n-   **Yes**\n-   :   For bugs, provide a [jtreg](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/) regression test as part of the changeset. For enhancements that directly affect one or more exported interfaces, add an adequate set of jtreg unit tests as part of the changeset. By convention all regression and unit tests should contain a [\\@bug tag](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS9) referencing at least one bugid.\n-\n-   :   An entirely new test (or tests) may not be required. For example, if the bug is an existing regression test failure, then when fixing the bug you should just add the new bug ID to the list of space-delimited bugs in the [\\@bug tag](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS) of the failing regression test, even if the test didn't need to be updated.\n-\n-   **No**\n-   :   An explanation for why a test is unnecessary or infeasible is required. Such an explanation is recorded by adding a label, and possibly a comment, to the bug report. The label has the prefix **`noreg`** for regression tests and **`nounit`** for unit tests. The suffix of the label is described in detail in the [JBS Label Dictionary](#noreg)\n-\n-#. **Is modification of shared Java code needed?**\n-\n-   **Yes**\n-   :   It's often sufficient to build and test on a single platform, but sometimes it's not. Use discretion.\n-\n-   **No**\n-   :   Continue\n-\n-#. **Is modification of shared C code needed?**\n-\n-   **Yes**\n-   :   Build and test on at least one instance of all three of the supported operating systems (Solaris, Linux, and Windows).\n-\n-   **No**\n-   :   Continue\n-\n-#. **Is modification of C or Java platform-specific code needed?**\n-\n-   **Yes**\n-   :   Build and test on all relevant platforms.  Code under `src\/solaris` builds on Solaris, Linux, and MacOS X despite its name.\n-\n-   **No**\n-   :   Continue\n-\n-#. **Run relevant regression and unit tests on all relevant platforms**\n-\n-   These include tests for external interfaces as well as other kinds of tests, e.g., HotSpot tests that use internal verification mechanisms.\n-\n-#. **Run relevant JCK tests on all relevant platforms**\n-\n-   Running JCK tests is particularly important if the change may have unexpected side-effects.\n-\n-#. **Request a review of the changes by sending an e-mail to the development alias**\n-\n-   A patch can be submitted as described in [Contributing](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/contribute\/). Alternatively, a [\"webrev\"](webrevHelp.html) may be generated and uploaded to the [community code review](https:\/\/cr.openjdk.java.net\/) server. The complete webrev generation and upload procedure is described at [https:\/\/cr.openjdk.java.net](https:\/\/cr.openjdk.java.net\/).\n-\n-   Changeset pushes before the [Feature Complete](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/jdk8\/milestones#Feature_Complete) require at least one [Reviewer](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#reviewer); pushes after the Feature Complete require at least two Reviewers. In either case, the more the merrier. Some teams may require more Reviewers. Check with members of the Project.\n-\n-   Reviewers should examine not only the code being added or changed but also the relevant unit or regression tests.\n-\n-   A change may require multiple Reviewers because it affects multiple areas.  Reviewers should be aware that they take full responsibility for the appropriateness and correctness of any changes in their area of expertise.  If something goes wrong (e.g., the build breaks) and the change&apos;s author is unavailable, they may be asked to deal with the problem. Potential Reviewers are encouraged to refuse to review code for which they aren't qualified.\n-\n-#. **Create a changeset**\n-\n-   Follow the instructions in [Producing a Changeset](#producing-a-changeset).\n-\n-#. **Update the bug content**\n-\n-   Bug descriptions and comments should be written in a professional manner.\n-\n-#. **Push the changeset into the Project's forest**\n-\n-   Follow the instructions in [Producing a Changeset](#producing-a-changeset). If working with a Sponsor, send the changeset to the development mailing list so that they can handle the final push.\n-\n-   The push will trigger a update to the bug which will make the following changes:\n-\n-    * Set the bug's \"Status\" to \"Resolved\" and \"Resolution to \"Fixed\".\n-    * Set the bug's \"Fix Version\/s\" to an appropriate release.\n-    * Set the bug's \"Resolved in Build\" to \"team\".\n-    * Add a Comment containing a reference to the changeset.\n-\n-_Congratulations!_ Your changeset will now make its way towards a promoted build. When the changeset becomes part of a promoted build, the bug's \"Resolved in Build\" will have a value of \\\"b\\[1-9\\]\\[0-9\\]&ast;\\\" to indicate the build number.\n-\n-# Testing the JDK\n-\n-::: {.box}\n-[Quick Links]{.boxheader}\n-\n-* [Using the run-test Framework](https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/doc\/testing.md)\n-* [JTReg Harness Documentation](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/)\n-* [Google Test Documentation](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/googletest\/blob\/master\/googletest\/docs\/primer.md)\n-:::\n-\n-In addition to your own Java applications, OpenJDK have support for two test frameworks, JTReg and GTest.

For more information on configuration and how to use the OpenJDK test framework, a.k.a. \"run-test framework\", see [`doc\/testing.md`](https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/doc\/testing.md).\n-\n-In general all changes should come with a regression test so if you're writing product code you should also be writing test code. There are a few examples where it doesn't make sence to write an explicit regression test. These should be tagged in JBS with one of the [noreg-labels](#noreg).\n-\n-A few key items to think about when writing a regression test:\n-\n-* A regression test should execute fast - a few seconds at most\n-* The test should only test the desired functionality - if you have several features to test, write more tests\n-* The test should pass reliably on all supported platforms - watch out for platform-specific differences such as path separators\n-* Binary files shouldn't be checked in, if your test needs to use one, the test should create it in some fashion\n-* Avoid shell scripts and relying on external commands as much as possible\n-\n-The JTReg documentation has a section on [how to write good JTReg tests](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/writetests.html).\n-\n-## JTReg\n-\n-In-depth documentation about the JTReg framework is found here: [JTReg harness](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/). JTReg itself is available in the [Code Tools Project](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/code-tools\/).\n-\n-Below is a small example of a JTReg test. It’s a clean Java class with a main method that is called from the test harness. If the test fails we throw a RuntimeException. This is picked up by the harness and is reported as a test failure. Try to always write a meaningful message in the exception. One that actually helps with understanding what went wrong once the test fails.\n-\n-    \/*\n-     * @test\n-     * @summary Make sure feature X handles Y correctly\n-     * @run main TestXY\n-     *\/\n-    public class TestXY {\n-        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n-            var result = X.y();\n-            if (result != expected_result) {\n-                throw new RuntimeException(\"X.y() gave \" + result + \", expexted \" + expected_result);\n-            }\n-        }\n-    }\n-\n-This example only utilizes three JTReg specific tags, `@test`, `@summary`, and `@run`. `@test` simply tells JTReg that this class is a test, and `@summary` provides a description of the test. `@run` tells JTReg how to execute the test. In this case we simply tell JTReg to execute the main method of the class `TestXY`. `@run` isn't strictly necessary for JTReg to execute the test, an implicit `@run` tag will be added if none exists. However, for clarity and in order to avoid bugs it's recommended to always explicitly use the `@run` tag.\n-\n-There are several other tags that can be used in JTReg tests. You can for instance associate the test with a specific bug that this test is a regression test for.\n-\n-    @bug 7000001\n-\n-Or you can specify a number of requirements that must be fulfilled for JTReg to execute the test.\n-\n-    @requires docker.support\n-    @requires os.family != ”windows”\n-    @requires os.maxMemory > 3G\n-    @requires os.arch==\"x86_64\" | os.arch==\"amd64\"\n-\n-You can also specify if the test requires specific modules, and you can specify command line flags and run the test in several different ways.\n-\n-    @modules java.base\/jdk.internal.misc\n-    @run main\/othervm -Xmx128m TestXY\n-\n-Note that you can have several `@run` tags in the same test with different command line options.\n-\n-JTReg also have support for labeling tests with keys using the `@key` tag. These keywords can then be used to filter the test selection. For instance if you have a UI test which needs to display a window you'll want to make sure the test harness doesn't try to run this test on a system which doesn't support headful tests. You do this by specifying\n-\n-    @key headful\n-\n-Another example is `@key randomness` that should be used to indicate that a test is using randomness - i.e. is intentionally non-deterministic.\n-\n-There are many other keywords in use and their usage may differ between areas in the JDK. Make sure you understand the conventions for the particular area you are testing since these are just examples.\n-\n-The [JTReg documentation](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jtreg\/) provides information on many more tags like these.\n-\n-The [compiler group](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/groups\/compiler\/) has a section in their wiki with [Guidelines for \"langtools\" tests](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/groups\/compiler\/tests.html).\n-\n-### Running OpenJDK JTReg Tests\n-\n-When configuring the OpenJDK build you can tell it where your JTReg installation is located. When providing this information you can later run `make run-test` to execute JTReg tests.\n-\n-    sh .\/configure --with-jtreg=\/path\/to\/jtreg\n-    make run-test TEST=tier1\n-\n-In the OpenJDK source tree you can find a directory called `test`. There are a large number of tests in this directory that are written to be used with JTReg.\n-\n-    make run-test TEST=test\/jdk\/java\/lang\/String\/\n-\n-You can also run JTReg without invoking make. In this case you’ll need to tell JTReg which JDK to test.\n-\n-    jtreg -jdk:\/path\/to\/jdk \/path\/to\/test\n-\n-## GTest\n-\n-As mentioned the Google test framework is mainly used for C++ unit tests. There are several of these in the `test\/hotspot` directory. Currently, only the C++ code in the JVM area is supported by the OpenJDK GTest framework. The tests can be run without starting the JVM, which enables testing of JVM data structures that would be fragile to play with in a running JVM.\n-\n-    static int demo_comparator(int a, int b) {\n-      if (a == b) {\n-        return 0;\n-      }\n-      if (a < b) {\n-        return -1;\n-      }\n-      return 1;\n-    }\n-\n-    TEST(Demo, quicksort) {\n-      int test_array[] = {7,1,5,3,6,9,8,2,4,0};\n-      int expected_array[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};\n-\n-      QuickSort::sort(test_array, 10, demo_comparator, false);\n-      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n-        ASSERT_EQ(expected_array[i], test_array[i]);\n-      }\n-    }\n-\n-`ASSERT_EQ` is one example of an assertion that can be used in the test. Below are a few other examples. A full list is found in the [Google Test Documentation](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/googletest\/blob\/master\/googletest\/docs\/primer.md).\n-\n-    ASSERT_TRUE(condition);\n-    ASSERT_FALSE(condition);\n-    EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual);\n-    EXPECT_LT(val1, val2);\n-    EXPECT_STREQ(expected_str, actual_str);\n-\n-`ASSERT` is a fatal assertion and will interrupt execution of the current sub-routine. `EXPECT` is a nonfatal assertion and will report the error but continues to run the test. All assertions have both an `ASSERT` and an `EXPECT` variant.\n-\n-For more information on how to write good GTests in HotSpot, see [`doc\/hotspot-unit-tests.md`](https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/doc\/hotspot-unit-tests.md).\n-\n-### Running OpenJDK GTests\n-\n-When configuring the OpenJDK build you can tell it where your GTest installation is located. Once configured, use make to run GTests.\n-\n-    sh .\/configure --with-gtest=\/path\/to\/gtest\n-    make test TEST=gtest\n-\n-You can also use a regular expression to filter which tests to run:\n-\n-    make test TEST=gtest:code.*:os.*\n-    make test TEST=gtest:$X\/$variant\n-\n-The second example above runs tests which match the regexp `$X.*` on a specific variant of the JVM. The variant is one of client, server, etc.\n-\n-## Excluding a Test\n-\n-Sometimes tests break. It could be e.g. due to bugs in the test itself, due to changed functionality in the code that the test is testing, or changes in the environment where the test is executed. While working on a fix, it can be useful to stop the test from being executed in everyone else's testing to reduce noise, especially if the test is expected to fail for more than a day. There are two ways to stop a test from being run in standard test runs: ProblemListing and using the `@ignore` keyword. Removing tests isn't the standard way to remove a failure. A failing test is often a regression and should ideally be handled with high urgency.\n-\n-I'll say it right away so that it's not forgotten at the end: Remember to remove the JBS id from the ProblemList or the test when the bug is closed. This is especially easy to forget if a bug is closed as a duplicate or 'Will Not Fix'. jcheck will report an error and prohibit a push if a PR is created for an issue that is found in a ProblemList if the fix doesn't remove the bug ID from the ProblemList.\n-\n-### ProblemListing jtreg tests\n-\n-ProblemListing should be used for a short term exclusion while a test is being fixed, and for the exclusion of intermittently failing tests that cause too much noise, but can still be useful to run on an ad-hoc basis. ProblemListing is done in the file `ProblemList.txt`. There are actually several ProblemList files to choose from. Their location and name hint about what area or feature each file belongs to. Each file has sections for different components. All ProblemList files complement each other to build the total set of tests to exclude in JTReg runs.\n-\n-~~~\n-test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList.txt\n-test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-aot.txt\n-test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-graal.txt\n-test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-non-cds-mode.txt\n-test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-Xcomp.txt\n-test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList-zgc.txt\n-test\/jaxp\/ProblemList.txt\n-test\/jdk\/ProblemList.txt\n-test\/jdk\/ProblemList-aot.txt\n-test\/jdk\/ProblemList-graal.txt\n-test\/jdk\/ProblemList-Xcomp.txt\n-test\/langtools\/ProblemList.txt\n-test\/langtools\/ProblemList-graal.txt\n-test\/lib-test\/ProblemList.txt\n-~~~\n-\n-Use the suitable ProblemList and add a line like this in the proper section:\n-\n-~~~\n-foo\/bar\/MyTest.java                        4711   windows-all\n-~~~\n-\n-In this example, `MyTest.java` is ProblemListed on windows, tracked by bug `JDK-4711`.\n-\n-Currently there's [no support for multiple lines for the same test](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/browse\/CODETOOLS-7902481). For this reason it's important to always make sure there's no existing entry for the test before adding a new one, as multiple entries might lead to unexpected results, e.g.\n-\n-~~~\n-foo\/bar\/MyTest.java                        4710   generic-all\n-...\n-foo\/bar\/MyTest.java                        4711   windows-all\n-~~~\n-\n-This would lead to `sun.tools.jcmd.MyTest.java` being ProblemListed only on `windows-all`. The proper way to write this is:\n-\n-~~~\n-foo\/bar\/MyTest.java                        4710,4711   generic-all,windows-all\n-~~~\n-\n-Although `windows-all` isn't strictly required in this example, it's preferable to specify platforms for each bugid (unless they are all `generic-all`), this makes it easier to remove one of the bugs from the list.\n-\n-#### ProblemListing some, but not all, test cases in a file\n-\n-Some tests contain several test cases and there may be a need to ProblemList only a few of them. To do this use the full test name, i.e. `<filename> + # + <test case id>`, where test case id can be specified in the test header. If no id is specified each test case can be referenced with `id` + ordinary number of the test case in the test file.\n-\n-Let's assume we have four test cases in `foo\/bar\/MyTest.java`:\n-\n-~~~\n-\/* @test *\/\n-\/* @test id=fancy_name *\/\n-\/* @test *\/\n-\/* @test *\/\n-~~~\n-\n-A ProblemList entry that excludes the first, second, and third test case would look like this:\n-\n-~~~\n-foo\/bar\/MyTest.java#id0          4720  generic-all\n-foo\/bar\/MyTest.java#fancy_name   4721  generic-all\n-foo\/bar\/MyTest.java#id2          4722  generic-all\n-~~~\n-\n-Due to an issue described in [CODETOOLS-7902712](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.java.net\/browse\/CODETOOLS-7902712) tests that contains more than one `@test` must actually use this way to specify all test cases if all of them should be ProblemListed. Specifying just the test name will not work.\n-\n-#### Running ProblemListed tests\n-\n-To run ad-hoc runs of ProblemListed tests use `RUN_PROBLEM_LISTS=true`.\n-\n-~~~\n-make test TEST=... JTREG=RUN_PROBLEM_LISTS=true\n-~~~\n-\n-### Exclude jtreg tests using `@ignore`\n-\n-The `@ignore` keyword is used in the test source code. This is mainly used for tests that are so broken that they may be harmful or useless, and is less common than ProblemListing. Examples can be tests that don't compile because something changed in the platform; or a test which might remove your `\/etc\/shadow`. Use `@ignore` with a bug reference in the test case to prevent the test from being run.\n-\n-~~~java\n-\/**\n- *  @test\n- *  @ignore 4711\n- *\n-~~~\n-\n-In this example, `MyTest.java` is excluded, tracked by bug `JDK-4711`. `@ignore` should always be placed directly before the first `@run` line in the test.\n-\n-### Dealing with JBS bugs for test exclusion\n-\n-ProblemListing and `@ignore`-ing are done in the JDK source tree, that means a check-in into the repository is needed. This in turn means that a unique JBS issue and a code review are needed. This is a good thing since it makes test problems visible.\n-\n-* **Code review**: ProblemListing a test is considered a [trivial](#trivial) change.\n-* **JBS issue**: A JBS issue is obviously created for the bug that caused the failure, we call this the _main issue_. To exclude the test, create a subtask to the main issue. Also add the label [`problemlist`](#problemlist) to the main issue.\n-\n-The fix for the main issue should remove the test from the ProblemList or remove the `@ignore` keyword from the test.\n-\n-#### Triage excluded issues\n-\n-After a failure is handled by excluding a test, the main JBS issue should be re-triaged and possibly given a new priority. This should be handled by the standard triage process. A test exclusion results in an outage in our testing. This outage should be taken into consideration when triaging, in addition to the impact of the bug itself.\n-\n-# Producing a Changeset\n-\n-This section is confined to the actual Mercurial mechanics required to produce a changeset:\n-\n-* [Setting a JDK User Name](#setting-a-jdk-user-name) reminds the user to confirm proper configuration.\n-* [Creating](#creating) includes instructions for the required format of a changeset comment and describes how to commit files to a changeset.\n-* [Merging](#merging) describes how to pull changes from a parent forest or clone and incorporate the changes into the current working set of files.\n-* [Pushing](#pushing) covers configuring ssh, setting the `default-push` path, and pushing changesets.\n-\n-## Setting a JDK User Name\n-\n-Ensure that _ui.username_ has a value in the `~\/.hgrc` file as described in [Verifying the Configuration](#verifying-the-configuration).\n-\n-## Creating\n-\n-The timing for creating a changeset is important. Creating the changeset long before it gets pushed into the parent repository may require complex merges. If a changeset is created before sufficient review or testing, a rollback may be required and a new changeset may be required to correct previous mistakes. The [mq extension](http:\/\/hgbook.red-bean.com\/hgbookch12.html#x16-26500012) is recommended for managing changes before they become committed to a changeset.\n-\n-In the examples below, the script `common\/bin\/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply the Mercurial command to all the repositories in the forest. So when you see _**`hg`**_, if you are dealing with one repository, just use \"`hg`\", if it's a forest, use \"`sh common\/bin\/hgforest.sh`\".\n-\n-\n-Each repository in the forest is managed independently. After editing files in the individual cloned repositories of the forest, the `hg status` command may be used to see the changes in a single repository.\n-\n-    $ hg root\n-    \/u\/iris\/sandbox\/box\n-    $ hg status\n-    ? duke\/images\/DukeTubbingSmall.png\n-    $ hg add duke\/images\/DukeTubbingSmall.png\n-    $ hg status\n-    A duke\/images\/DukeTubbingSmall.png\n-\n-To see changes made to the repositories use _**`hg`**_ `status`:\n-\n-    $ hg status\n-    [.]\n-    A duke\/images\/DukeTubbingSmall.png\n-\n-In this example, the repository was previously cloned as described in [Cloning a Sandbox Repository](#clone). A new file `DukeTubbingSmall.png` was added to a new subdirectory.\n-\n-#### Formatting a Changeset Comment\n-\n-A single change is described by a block of text of the following form:\n-\n-    <bugid>: <synopsis-of-symptom>\n-    Summary: <summary-of-code-change>\n-    Reviewed-by: <reviewer>+\n-    Contributed-by: <contributor-email>\n-\n-There may be more than one _bugid_ line, but there must be at least one.\n-\n-The _summary_ line is optional, but authors are strongly encouraged to include one if the nature of the change isn't obvious from the synopsis. It's just one line, meant to give the reader a clue as to how the code changed. A more complete description of the change belongs in the bug report.\n-\n-A _reviewed-by_ line is required. Reviewers must have the ability to deal with any adverse consequences of the change, and so must themselves be authors. They are therefore identified by their OpenJDK usernames rather than full e-mail addresses.\n-\n-The _contributed-by_ line is optional. If present, it's a list of comma-separated email addresses. It should be included only when the author or authors of the change don't have commit rights to the target repository and thus would not otherwise receive acknowledgment.\n-\n-There will be exceptions for merge changesets, tag changesets, etc.\n-\n-Example:\n-\n-    1234567: NPE thrown on FileInputStream(\"\")\n-    Summary: Rewrite precondition-checking code in io.c\n-    Reviewed-by: mr\n-    Contributed-by: Ben Bitdiddle <ben at bits.org>\n-\n-If a changeset contains multiple unrelated changes (this is frowned upon, but may happen from time to time) then its comment will contain multiple blocks of the above form, separated by blank lines.\n-\n-The required format of the comments will be enforced whenever the changeset is pushed into the JDK master or team repository forests. Other Projects may copy these conventions, adopt some other conventions, or have no conventions, depending upon their goals.\n-\n-#### Committing a Changeset\n-\n-The following commands commit all of the changes in a repository to a changeset.\n-\n-    $ cat ..\/message\n-    1111111: Missing Duke gif\n-    Summary:  Add missing file\n-    Reviewed-by: iag\n-    $ hg commit -l ..\/message\n-    $ hg toutgoing\n-    [.]\n-    comparing with http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/sandbox\/box\n-    searching for changes\n-    changeset:   23:fb12953f3a35\n-    tag:         tip\n-    user:        iris\n-    date:        Wed Dec 12 21:05:59 2007 -0800\n-    summary:     1111111: Missing Duke gif\n-\n-## Merging\n-\n-It's often necessary to merge local changes with those made in the parent repositories. The first step in a merge process is to retrieve (or pull) the collection of changesets which have been pushed since the last merge or initial clone. If there if there are merge conflicts, then they must be resolved. [Chapter 3](http:\/\/hgbook.red-bean.com\/hgbookch3.html#x7-530003) of the Mercurial book contains detailed information on the merging process.\n-\n-There are two basic ways to update the working set files in the repositories:\n-\n-Option 1: _**`hg`**_ `pull`\n-\n-> One way to merge the parent repository with the working set of files is to use _**`hg`**_ `pull` all by itself. This option allows merging off-line or at a later time.\n->\n->     $ hg pull\n->     [.]\n->     pulling from http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/sandbox\/box\n->     searching for changes\n->     no changes found\n->\n-> In Mercurial, pulling changesets will not update or merge into the working set of files. To update the clone, run _**`hg`**_ `update`. If the update reports conflicts, run _**`hg`**_ `merge` to resolve them.\n-\n-Option 2: _**`hg`**_ `fetch`\n-\n-> Alternatively, use _**`hg`**_ `fetch` to pull the changes, update the working set files, and create simple merge changesets as necessary. The fetch extension is distributed with Mercurial but needs to be enabled. Edit the `.hgrc` to include the following entries:\n->\n->     [extensions]\n->     fetch=\n->\n-> Once the fetch extension has been enabled, _**`hg`**_ `fetch` may be invoked as follows:\n->\n->     $ hg fetch\n->     [.]\n->     pulling from http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/sandbox\/box\n->     searching for changes\n->     no changes found\n-\n-> ---\n-> Actual file merging will be done with the selected Mercurial merging tool see [MergeProgram](https:\/\/www.selenic.com\/mercurial\/wiki\/index.cgi\/MergeProgram) for the details on how to define the selected merge tool in ` ~\/.hgrc`.\n-\n-> ---\n-\n-## Pushing\n-\n-In order to push changesets into the parent repository, some additional configuration is required. The following sections describe the operations that will be performed by users with push access.\n-\n-#### Generating an SSH Key\n-\n-All pushes require an ssh key which must be installed on the Mercurial server. The `ssh-keygen` command generates an ssh key. The `-b` option overrides the default number of bits for the key. Allow a few minutes to generate a 4096 bit key; a key of at least 2048 bits is recommended. While it's possible to use ssh without a passphrase, this is **strongly** discouraged. Empty or insecure passphrases may be reset using `ssh-keygen -p`; this doesn't change the keys.\n-\n-    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096\n-    Enter file in which to save the key(\/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa):\n-    Generating public\/private rsa key pair.\n-    Enter passphrase(empty for no passphrase):\n-    Enter same passphrase again:\n-    Your identification has been saved in \/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa.\n-    Your public key has been saved in \/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub.\n-    The key fingerprint is:\n-    md5 4096 c2:b7:00:e6:4b:da:ea:ec:32:30:f5:bd:12:26:04:83 iris@duke\n-    The key's randomart image is:\n-    +--[ RSA 4096]----+\n-    |    E.=          |\n-    |     . *         |\n-    |      o .   .    |\n-    |         + o     |\n-    |        S + .    |\n-    |       .   + .   |\n-    |        + + +..  |\n-    |       * . oo+.  |\n-    |      o . .o..   |\n-    +-----------------+\n-\n-The `~\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub` is a text file containing the public ssh key. This file should be mailed as an attachment along with the JDK username to [keys(at)openjdk.java.net](mailto:keys-at-openjdk.java.net). An administrator will install your key on the server and notify you on completion. This process may take a couple of days.\n-\n-> ---\n-> Users behind a SOCKS firewall can add a directive to the `~\/.ssh\/config` file to connect to the OpenJDK Mercurial server:\n->\n->     Host *.openjdk.java.net\n->     ProxyCommand \/usr\/lib\/ssh\/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect -h [socks_proxy_address] %h %p\n->\n-> See the `ssh-socks5-proxy-connect` man page and `ssh-config` man page for more information. Other systems may require proxy access via other programs. Some Linux distributions provide the `corkscrew` package which provides ssh access through HTTP proxies.\n->\n-> **It's recommended that all users check with their network administrators before installing any kind of TCP forwarding tool on their network. Many corporations and institutions have strict security policies in this area.**\n-\n-> ---\n-\n-#### SSH Shortcuts\n-\n-The following section provides some tips for improving the usability of ssh-related operations.\n-\n-* _Using SSH in multiple shells_\n-\n-  To avoid having to constantly type in the passphrase, use the ssh-agent on your local client to cache your pashphrase:\n-\n-      $ eval `ssh-agent`\n-      Agent pid 17450\n-      $ ssh-add\n-      Enter passphrase for \/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa:\n-      Identity added: \/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa(\/u\/iris\/.ssh\/id_rsa)\n-\n-  The same ssh-agent process can be shared with multiple shells. There are various ways to do this. Bash users can accomplish this with the following code in `.bashrc`:\n-\n-      if [ \"$PS1\" -a -d $HOME\/.ssh ]; then\n-        if [ \"x$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\" = x ]; then\n-          eval `ssh-agent | grep -v 'echo Agent pid'`\n-          ssh-add\n-          trap \"echo Killing SSH agent $SSH_AGENT_PID; kill $SSH_AGENT_PID\" 0\n-        fi\n-      fi\n-\n-  For secure operation, only start an ssh-agent when needed and kill it off when the shell completes. Test this by running `ssh 'hostname' echo hello` multiple times.\n-\n-* _Logging in without a password_\n-\n-  To avoid needing to constantly type in the password, add the public key to the list of ssh authorized keys.\n-\n-      $ cat ~\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub >> ~\/.ssh\/authorized_keys\n-      $ chmod 600 ~\/.ssh\/authorized_keys\n-\n-#### Setting the `default-push` Path to the Server Repositories\n-\n-<!--\n-#. Option 1: Add default-push path to every <code>.hg\/hgrc<\/code>\n--->\n-\n-This is the typical development model:\n-\n-::: {style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n-~~~{.mermaid caption=\"Diagram of server repos and user's clone\" format=svg theme=neutral}\n-graph TD\n-    subgraph hg.openjdk.java.net\n-        origin(jdk9\/dev)\n-    end\n-    origin --> |clone| local(9dev)\n-    local --> |push| origin\n-~~~\n-:::\n-\n-Changesets need to be _pushed_ via ssh to the read\/write repository which resides on the OpenJDK Mercurial server. The easiest way to do this is to have each repository define the \"default-push\" path in every repository's `.hg\/hgrc` file. The `.hg\/hgrc` file in isn't a managed file - it's private to the repository. The following example defines the \"default\" and \"default-push\" paths for clones of the jdk9\/dev team repository.\n-\n-    [paths]\n-    default = http:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/jdk9\/dev\n-    default-push = ssh:\/\/<JDK_username>@hg.openjdk.java.net\/jdk9\/dev\n-\n-Given a `JDK_username` this simple script will attempt to do this for all the repositories:\n-\n-    #!\/bin\/sh\n-    username=$1\n-    hgdirs=\"`find . -type d -name .hg`\"\n-    for i in ${hgdirs}; do\n-      d=\"`dirname ${i}`\"\n-      defpush=\"`(cd ${d} && hg paths default-push 2> \/dev\/null)`\"\n-      if [ \"${defpush}\" = \"\" ] ; then\n-        defpath=\"`(cd ${d} && hg paths default 2> \/dev\/null)`\"\n-        if [ \"${defpath}\" != \"\" ] ; then\n-          defpush=\"`echo ${defpath} | sed -e 's@http:\/\/\\([^\/]*\/[^\/]*\/[^\/]*\\)\/\\(.*\\)@ssh:\/\/$username\\@\\1\/\\2@'`\"\n-          cp ${i}\/hgrc ${i}\/hgrc.orig\n-          echo \"default-push = ${defpush}\" >> ${i}\/hgrc\n-          echo \"Added default-push: ${defpush}\"\n-        fi\n-      fi\n-    done\n-    for i in ${hgdirs}; do\n-      d=\"`dirname ${i}`\"\n-      echo \"(cd ${d} && hg paths)\"\n-      (cd ${d} && hg paths)\n-    done\n-    exit 0\n-\n-<!--\n-#. Option 2: Use the <code>defpath<\/code> ExtensionAnother way to setup the default-push path is to use the Mercurial defpath extension, which is available in \/java\/jdk\/lib\/hgext\/defpath.py. To enable this extension add the following to the <code>~\/hgrc<\/code> file:\n-<blockquote><pre>\n-[extensions]\n-defpath = \/java\/jdk\/lib\/hgext\/defpath.py  # Or the pathname of a local copy\n-<\/pre><\/blockquote>\n-     The defpath extension actually adds two new Mercurial subcommands:\n-    defpath to operate upon a single repository and fdefpath for an entire\n-    forest. hg help defpath or hg help fdefpath will tell you more. For a\n-    freshly cloned open\/closed forest the command you probably want is\n-<blockquote><pre>\n-$ hg fdefpath -dgv\n-<\/pre><\/blockquote>\n-     Be sure to try this with the -n flag first to see if it will do what\n-    you actually expect. If your OpenJDK username differs from your Oracle\n-    username then add -u name to the command line.\n-     The defpath extension defines the default-push path, which is the path\n-    that Mercurial uses by default in push operations.\n--->\n-\n-#### Pushing a Changeset\n-\n-[Committers](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#committer) can use the _**hg**_ `push` command to propagate changesets into the repositories.\n-\n-Most developers will only find a need to create changesets in one or two repositories. However, it's important that before any changesets are pushed, the corresponding forest pull and merge with the destination forest be performed; otherwise there is a risk of breaking the build.\n-\n-    $ hg push\n-\n-After the push has been accepted, an automatic e-mail notification will be sent to the [mailing list](https:\/\/mail.openjdk.java.net) associated with the repository. In most cases notifications are sent to the Project's _-dev_ mailing list. Some Projects with high traffic _-dev_ mailing lists use a dedicated _-changes_ list for notifications.\n-\n-> ---\n-> Who has push access?\n->\n-> All of a Project's [Committers](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#committer) can push to all of the the Project's repositories.\n->\n-> Some Projects may chose to restrict the set of Committers with push to key repositories. For instance, JDK Release Projects restrict push access to MASTER repositories to Committers who are either integrators or members of the Release Engineering Team.\n->\n-> Refer to the [Nominating a Contributor or Author to be a Committer](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/index.html#project-committer) section of the [Project](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/index.html) page for information about becoming a Project Committer.\n-\n-> ---\n-\n-## Backing Out a Change\n-\n-If a change causes a regression that can't be fixed within reasonable time the best way to handle the regression can be to back out the change. Backing out means that the inverse (anti-delta) of the change is pushed to effectively undo the change in the repository. There are two parts to this task, how to do the bookkeeping in JBS, and how to do the actual backout in mercurial.\n-\n-The backout is a regular change and will have to go through the standard code review process, but is considered a [trivial](#trivial) change. The rationale is that a backout is usually urgent in nature and the change itself is automatically created by hg, and reviewed by the person who is performing the backout, so even though only one additional Reviewer is required the change will in practice get two reviews.\n-\n-### How to work with JBS when a change is backed out\n-\n-#. Close the original JBS issue **(O)**.\n-   * \"Verify\" the issue and choose \"Fix Failed\".\n-#. If the intention is to fix the change and submit it again, create a redo-issue **(R)** to track that the work still needs to be done.\n-   * Clone **(O)** and add the prefix `[REDO]` on the summary - the clone becomes the redo-issue **(R)**.\n-   * Make sure relevant information is brought to **(R)**.\n-   * Remember that comments aren't brought over when cloning.\n-#. Create a backout-issue **(B)**:\n-   * Alternative 1 - the regression is identified directly.\n-     * Create a sub-task to **(R)** with the same summary, prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.\n-   * Alternative 2 - an investigation issue is created **(I)**, and during the investigation backing out the change is identified as the best solution.\n-     * Use the investigation issue **(I)** for the backout.\n-     * Change summary of **(I)** to the same as **(O)** and prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.\n-     * Move and change type of **(I)** to become a sub-task of **(R)**.\n-   * Alternative 3 - no redo issue was created.\n-     * Create a backout-issue **(B)** with the same summary as **(O)**, prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.\n-     * Link **(B)** and **(O)**.\n-\n-ProblemList entries and `@ignore` keywords will continue to point to the original bug (unless updated at back out). This is accepted since there is a clone link to follow.\n-\n-### How to work with mercurial when a change is backed out\n-\n-In order to backout a change, the `hg backout` command is recommended, which essentially applies the anti delta of the change. Make sure you perform the backout in the most upstream repostiory the change has escaped to.\n-\n-~~~\n-hg backout [OPTION]... [-r] REV\n-\n-reverse effect of earlier changeset\n-\n-    Prepare a new changeset with the effect of REV undone in the current\n-    working directory.\n-\n-    If REV is the parent of the working directory, then this new changeset is\n-    committed automatically. Otherwise, hg needs to merge the changes and the\n-    merged result is left uncommitted.\n-~~~\n-\n-# Code Owners\n-\n-This list is intended to make it easier to identify which email list to include in code reviews when making changes in different areas. The list may also help when assigning bugs based on which code they are found in. Please note that some directories may have been created or removed between releases. The intention here is to include directories that exists in mainline, LTS releases and other releases (post JDK 9) commonly being updated.\n-\n-## Area mailing lists\n-\n-* Build: [`build-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:build-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-* Client\n-  * AWT: [`awt-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:awt-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Beans: [`beans-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:beans-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Java 2D: [`2d-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:2d-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Java FX: [`openjfx-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:openjfx-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * jpackage: [`core-libs-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:core-libs-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Sound: [`sound-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:sound-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Swing: [`swing-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:swing-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-* Core Libs: [`core-libs-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:core-libs-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Net: [`net-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:net-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * NIO: [`nio-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:nio-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-* HotSpot: [`hotspot-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:hotspot-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Compiler: [`hotspot-compiler-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:hotspot-compiler-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * GC: [`hotspot-gc-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:hotspot-gc-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Runtime: [`hotspot-runtime-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:hotspot-runtime-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * JFR: [`hotspot-jfr-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:hotspot-jfr-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Serviceability: [`serviceability-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:serviceability-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-* I18n: [`i18n-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:i18n-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-* LangTools\n-  * Amber Project: [`amber-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:amber-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Javac: [`compiler-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:compiler-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Javadoc: [`javadoc-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:javadoc-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * JShell: [`kulla-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:kulla-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Panama Project: [`panama-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:panama-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-  * Valhalla Project: [`valhalla-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:valhalla-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-* Security: [`security-dev@openjdk.java.net`](mailto:security-dev@openjdk.java.net)\n-\n-## Directory to area mapping\n-\n-* `make` – Build team\n-* `hotspot` – HotSpot\n-  * `cpu` – Compiler, Runtime\n-  * `jdk.*` – Compiler\n-  * `os` – Runtime\n-  * `os_cpu` – Compiler\n-  * `share`\n-    * `adlc` – Compiler\n-    * `aot` – Compiler\n-    * `asm` – Runtime\n-    * `c1` – Compiler\n-    * `ci` – Compiler\n-    * `classfile` – Runtime\n-    * `code` – Compiler\n-    * `compiler` – Compiler\n-    * `gc` – GC\n-    * `include` – HotSpot\n-    * `interpreter` – Runtime\n-    * `jfr` – JFR\n-    * `jvmci` – Compiler\n-    * `libadt` – Compiler\n-    * `logging` – Runtime\n-    * `memory` – Runtime, GC\n-    * `metaprogramming` – Runtime\n-    * `oops` – Runtime\n-    * `opto` – Compiler\n-    * `precompiled` – Runtime\n-    * `prims` – Runtime, Serviceability\n-    * `runtime` – Runtime\n-    * `services` – Runtime\n-    * `shark` – Compiler\n-    * `trace` – Runtime\n-    * `utilities` – Runtime\n-* `java.base`\n-  * Core Libs should almost always be included but LangTools, HotSpot, Security and\/or I18n may also be involved.\n-  * `classes`\n-    * `crypto` – Security\n-    * `internal` – HotSpot, Core Libs\n-    * `invoke` – Core Libs\n-    * `io` – NIO\n-    * `lang` – Core Libs\n-    * `launcher` – LangTools\n-    * `math` – Core Libs\n-    * `net` – Net\n-    * `nio` – NIO\n-    * `reflect` – Core Libs\n-    * `security` – Security\n-    * `text` – I18n\n-    * `time` – Core Libs\n-    * `util` – I18n, Core Libs\n-  * `conf`\n-    * `sdp` – Net\n-    * `security` – Security\n-  * `legal` –\n-  * `lib\/security` – Security\n-  * `man`\n-    * `java.1` -

Please let us know if there's anything in the guide that isn't clear.\n-\n-# Glossary\n-\n-[**accepted**]{#accepted} (by the CCC)\n-:   The stage of the CCC process after \"DRAFT\", and \"PROPOSED\". At this stage the primary goals are to ensure that the proposed changes are suitable for the release in a general sense and that the requisite JCK and SQE resources will be available.\n-\n-[**approved**]{#approved} (by the CCC)\n-:   The stage of the CCC process after \"FINAL\". The CCC has approved the final version of the request which permits push into the project forest.\n-\n-[**changeset**]{#changeset}\n-:   A collection of changes with respect to the current clone of a repository.\n-\n-[**development freeze**]{#developmentfreeze}\n-:   The date by which all planned work should be complete for a particular line of development. After a line's development freeze, only exit-criteria bugs may be fixed in that line.\n-\n-[**forest**]{#forest}\n-:   A collection of Mercurial repositories which can be managed as a set of nested repositories. The name \"Forest\" originally came from the Mercurial \"Forest Extension\" which can be used with some versions of Mercurial, but in general is no longer recommended. The script `common\/bin\/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply a Mercurial `hg` command to all the repositories in a forest.\n-\n-[**Group**]{#group}\n-:   A collection of [Participants](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/bylaws#participant) who engage in open conversation about a common interest. That interest may be in the creation, enhancement, or maintenance of a specific body of code or it may lie in other areas, e.g., quality, documentation, or evangelism. See the [Group overview](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/groups\/).\n-\n-[**Mercurial**]{#mercurial}\n-:   A free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source bundles and binary packages for Mercurial are available at [https:\/\/www.selenic.com\/mercurial\/wiki\/index.cgi](https:\/\/www.selenic.com\/mercurial\/wiki\/index.cgi\/Mercurial). The main Mercurial documentation is available at [http:\/\/hgbook.red-bean.com](https:\/\/hgbook.red-bean.com\/).\n-\n-[**Project**]{#project}\n-:   A collaborative effort to produce a specific artifact, which may be a body of code, or documentation, or some other material. See the [Project overview](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/projects\/).\n-\n-[**repository**]{#repository}\n-:   A directory tree in the filesystem that Mercurial treats specially. This tree contains the source files and their revision history.\n-\n-[**trivial**]{#trivial}\n-:   A change that is small, well contained, and that makes no semantic changes. Typical examples are fixing obvious typos or renaming a local identifier. A trivial change can also be pushing an already-reviewed change that was missed in an earlier push (e.g., forgot to add a file) or generated changes like a [`git revert`](#backing-out-a-change). It's up to the author of a change to claim that the change is trivial in the RFR, and it's up to the Reviewer whether to approve such a claim. A change is trivial only if the Reviewer agrees that it is. A trivial change doesn't need to wait 24 hours before being pushed, and it only needs one Reviewer, even in areas where stricter rules for pushing normally apply.\n-\n-[**webrev**]{#webrev}\n-:   A tool and its output. In JDK release forests, the script, [`webrev.ksh`](https:\/\/hg.openjdk.java.net\/code-tools\/webrev\/raw-file\/tip\/webrev.ksh), examines a forest or repository to generate a set of web-based views of differences.\n","filename":"src\/index.md","additions":0,"deletions":1807,"binary":false,"changes":1807,"status":"deleted"}]}
