If your PR gets accepted, it will be squashed and pushed by the OpenJDK bots. This means that if you make changes to your `master` branch, it will diverge from the upstream `master` branch. This in turn means that your repo will forever be out of sync with the upstream repo, which will cause merge conflicts every single time you want to update your repo from upstream. Having a separate branch for each change also means that you can easily work on many different changes in parallel in the same code repository. Unless you know what you are doing, the recommendation is also to always base your new branch on the `master` branch.\n","filename":"src\/guide\/cloning-the-jdk.md","additions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false,"changes":2,"status":"modified"}]}
