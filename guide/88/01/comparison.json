In practice though, we have seen several examples where the number of significant changes hasn't been the dominating factor in a Committer vote. A contributor's work in another OpenJDK project may also be relevant for the vote. What the vote should ultimately test is the committer's commitment to the OpenJDK project for which the vote applies - is it believed that the person is dedicated and willing to spend time and effort on the project? Is the person believed to be a good citizen of the project?
