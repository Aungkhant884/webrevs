A clone of the entire code base is made and hosted in a separate ramp down repository (e.g. [openjdk\/jdk17](https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk17)). During the ramp down of a release we focus on bug fixing and stabilization in order to get the JDK ready for release. In RDP1 you may continue to fix P1-P3 product bugs (and some other issues) in the stabilization repo. For detailed information on what can be fixed when, see [JEP 3](https:\/\/openjdk.org\/jeps\/3).
