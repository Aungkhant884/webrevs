You might even want to leave some logging in the code you check in, to facilitate future diagnostics.\n+\n+The appropriate way to print logging output from HotSpot is through the [Unified Logging Framework (JEP 158)](https:\/\/openjdk.java.net\/jeps\/158). It gives you a lot of nice features and enables common command-line options for all logging. Messages can also be \"decorated\" with e.g. uptime, level, tags. The JEP contains a thorough description of the feature, but a quick example might look like:\n+\n+~~~c++\n+log_info(gc, marking)(\"Mark Stack Usage: \" SIZE_FORMAT \"M\", _mark_stack_usage \/ M);\n+~~~\n+\n+Where 'gc' and 'marking' are tags, and 'info' is the log level. This would be visible if the JVM were run with any of the following flags:\n+\n+~~~c++\n+-Xlog:gc+marking=info\n+-Xlog:gc+marking\n+-Xlog:gc*\n+~~~\n+\n+The API should be similar to:\n+\n+~~~c++\n+log_<level>(Tag1[,...])(fmtstr, ...)\n+~~~\n+\n+At the time of writing, the different log levels can be found in [src\/hotspot\/share\/logging\/log.hpp](https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/blob\/master\/src\/hotspot\/share\/logging\/log.hpp).\n+\n","filename":"src\/index.md","additions":34,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":34,"status":"modified"}]}
