Searching however is case insensitive. This means that if you group a set of issues in a gadget based on a label, and then click one of the groups to see the list of issues, that list will contain more results than the gadget if there are usages of the label with different casing. This can be very confusing and for this reason the recommendation is to stick with the commonly used case for all labels, regardless of your personal taste for upper or lower case letters. Most labels are lower case only, but there are examples where upper case letters are used in the most common version of a label.\n+\n+> ---\n+\n+<table class=\"dictionary\">\n+  <tr style=\"text-align:left;\"><th>Label<\/th><th>Description<\/th><\/tr>\n+  <tr>\n+    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n+      [*(Area)***`-interest`**]{#area-interest}\n+    <\/td>\n+    <td class=\"dictionary\">\n+      Used to indicate that an area (usually a team or project) is interested in the issue.

The exact reason for the intermittent failure is per definition unknown. Once the reason has been identified the issue is no more considered intermittent. An issue isn't intermittent if some characteristics has been found that triggers the failure consistently, even if the actual cause for the failure has not been found. For instance if a test fails every time it is executed on a specific host but not on other hosts it wouldn't be considered intermittent as it fails consistently on that specific host.

One example is where a test fails consistently on a specific host, or due to specific conditions in the environment.
