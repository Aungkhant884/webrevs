See [The Importance of Writing Stuff Down](https:\/\/stuartmarks.wordpress.com\/2023\/02\/22\/the-importance-of-writing-stuff-down) for a good explanation as to why it is important.\n+Once you are made, or you make yourself, the assignee of an issue you take on the responsibility of moving the issue through to resolution - providing the current status, and ultimately leaving a record for others in the future to understand what happened. There are no set rules for how you manage the bug while you are assigned to it, as it depends on the type and importance of an issue. A simple update to the doc needs little to be done, fix the problem and close the issue; an intricate timing issue or crash should be handled differently - documenting your progress in identifying the problem (e.g. [JDK-8212207](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.org\/browse\/JDK-8212207), [JDK-6984895](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.org\/browse\/JDK-6984895), [JDK-8287982](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.org\/browse\/JDK-8287982)), this is especially helpful if you ultimately move the issue to a different area as you have found that the problem lies elsewhere, or is closed as [Won't Fix]{.jbs-value}. Your updates then provide a resource to others to better understand what has been done or the code itself.
