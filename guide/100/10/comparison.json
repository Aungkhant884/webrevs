Regressions are often higher priority than long-standing bugs and may block a release if not fixed. An example of a P1 would be an issue that is blocking a build or a release, whereas a P5 would be a minor typo in a code comment.\n+* In the [Description]{.jbs-field}, always include (if possible):\n+    * error messages\n+    * assert messages\n+    * stack trace\n+    * command line information\n+    * relevant information from the logs\n+    * full name of any failing tests\n+    * If the information provided is long it should be added as attachments\n+* Avoid including in the description or comments:\n+    * personal information\n+    * passwords, logins, machine names\n+    * logs which may include sensitive data\n+* If the failure isn't reproducible with an existing OpenJDK test, attach a reproducer if possible, having a test case will decrease the time required to resolve the issue.\n+* In general the [CPU]{.jbs-field} and\/or [OS]{.jbs-field} fields should not be set. **ONLY** use them if you know that the issue is only relevant to a particular platform or set of platforms.\n+* Provide the output of `java -version`  whenever possible - this version information is particularly critical for hangs, JVM bugs, and network issues.\n+* Always file separate bugs for different issues.\n+    * If two crashes look related, but not similar enough to be sure they are the same, it's easier to later close a bug as a duplicate than it is to separate out one bug into two.\n+\n+Things to keep in mind when requesting an improvement:\n+\n+* Unlike reporting a problem, when it comes to improvements, what constitutes a reasonable request can take discussion, and in general it is encouraged that the mailing list for the area is used to suggest an improvement before filing.\n+* Enhancements to The Java Language Specification and The JVM Specification are managed through the [Java Community Process](http:\/\/jcp.org\/).\n+\n+To find out which component to use for different bugs, consult the [directory to area mapping](#directory-to-area-mapping).\n+\n+### Implementing a large change\n+When managing the work for a large change, especially when the work involves multiple engineers, it is recommended that the work is distributed across one or more \"implementation\" issues which should be linked to the main [Enhancement]{.jbs-field} with a \"blocks\" link along with any relevant CSRs. The [Enhancement]{.jbs-field} should not be considered done until all the blocking elements are completed.  The use of subTasks for [Enhancement]{.jbs}s is not recommended unless all the [Sub-task]{.jbs-field}s are relevant to the fix, if it were to be backported, for example [JDK-8231641](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.org\/browse\/JDK-8231641) or [JDK-8171407](https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.org\/browse\/JDK-8171407),\n+\n+### Implementing a JEP\n+It is recommended that for [JEP]{.jbs-field}s that the implementation is spread across one or more [Enhancement]{.jbs-field}s as above.\n+\n+## Issue states\n+\n+JBS only has a few states in which an issue can be in:\n+\n+<table class=\"dictionary\" summary=\"JBS Label Dictionary\">\n+  <tr style=\"text-align:left;\"><th>Type<\/th><th>Covers<\/th><\/tr>\n+<tr>\n+    <td class=\"dictionary\">[New]{.jbs-field}<\/td>\n+    <td class=\"dictionary\">Initial state after an issue is filed.

Searching however is case insensitive. This means that if you group a set of issues in a gadget based on a label, and then click one of the groups to see the list of issues, that list will contain more results than the gadget if there are usages of the label with different casing. This can be very confusing and for this reason the recommendation is to stick with the commonly used case for all labels, regardless of your personal taste for upper or lower case letters. Most labels are lower case only, but there are examples where upper case letters are used in the most common version of a label. Use of the autocomplete popup window (described above) when adding labels will avoid inadvertent introduction of labels with differing case.\n+> When using labels in Jira gadgets (like pie charts, heat maps, and statistics tables) Jira will be case-sensitive and treat e.g. OpenJDK and openjdk as two different labels.
