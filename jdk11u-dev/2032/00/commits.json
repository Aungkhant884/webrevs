[{"commit":{"message":"Backport 33d9a857308eed53e06b448691910bc8aa2f8fc9\n\njdk11 also has the bug of JDK-8307572, so I propose to backport the fix\nto jdk11u. This is not a clean backport. Main changes:\n\n1) Definition of reg_class v4_reg..v7_reg, and operand\nvRegD_V4..vRegD_V7 are missing in jdk11u aarch64.ad, which was\nintroduced in JDK-8214527. Added those definitions in this patch, as we\nneed to claim them to be killed in match rules.\n\n2) JDK-8274243 (not a valid backport for 11u) changed\nMacroAssembler::encode_iso_array() a lot, but the bug of invalid use of\nv4\/v5 still exists before and after that patch. Fixed the conflicts by\nusing 11u naming convention.\n\nNo new jtreg test failure with both release and fastdebug build. Test\ncase added in JDK-8307572 passes now, which fails without the backport."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/aarch64.ad"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/macroAssembler_aarch64.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/macroAssembler_aarch64.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/stubGenerator_aarch64.cpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/c2\/aarch64\/TestIntrinsicsRegStress.java"}],"sha":"9940bbd63286c3eac2bb3aca1f82340188159b56"}]
