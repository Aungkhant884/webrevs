Encoding classes generate functions which are\n-\/\/ called by Machine Instruction Nodes in order to generate the bit\n-\/\/ encoding of the instruction.  Operands specify their base encoding\n-\/\/ interface with the interface keyword.  There are currently\n-\/\/ supported four interfaces, REG_INTER, CONST_INTER, MEMORY_INTER, &\n-\/\/ COND_INTER.  REG_INTER causes an operand to generate a function\n-\/\/ which returns its register number when queried.  CONST_INTER causes\n-\/\/ an operand to generate a function which returns the value of the\n-\/\/ constant when queried.  MEMORY_INTER causes an operand to generate\n-\/\/ four functions which return the Base Register, the Index Register,\n-\/\/ the Scale Value, and the Offset Value of the operand when queried.\n-\/\/ COND_INTER causes an operand to generate six functions which return\n-\/\/ the encoding code (ie - encoding bits for the instruction)\n-\/\/ associated with each basic boolean condition for a conditional\n-\/\/ instruction.  Instructions specify two basic values for encoding.\n-\/\/ They use the ins_encode keyword to specify their encoding class\n-\/\/ (which must be one of the class names specified in the encoding\n-\/\/ block), and they use the opcode keyword to specify, in order, their\n-\/\/ primary, secondary, and tertiary opcode.  Only the opcode sections\n-\/\/ which a particular instruction needs for encoding need to be\n-\/\/ specified.\n-encode %{\n-  \/\/ Build emit functions for each basic byte or larger field in the intel\n-  \/\/ encoding scheme (opcode, rm, sib, immediate), and call them from C++\n-  \/\/ code in the enc_class source block.  Emit functions will live in the\n-  \/\/ main source block for now.  In future, we can generalize this by\n-  \/\/ adding a syntax that specifies the sizes of fields in an order,\n-  \/\/ so that the adlc can build the emit functions automagically\n-\n-  enc_class Java_To_Runtime(method meth) %{\n-  %}\n-\n-%}\n-\n-\n-\/\/ Platform dependent source\n-\n-source %{\n-\n-%}\n","filename":"src\/hotspot\/os_cpu\/linux_aarch64\/linux_aarch64.ad","additions":0,"deletions":69,"binary":false,"changes":69,"status":"deleted"},{"patch":"@@ -1,27 +0,0 @@\n-\/\/\n-\/\/ Copyright (c) 1999, 2008, Oracle and\/or its affiliates.
