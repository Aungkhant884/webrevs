License Grants and Conditions\n+--------------------------------\n+\n+2.1. Grants\n+\n+Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n+non-exclusive license:\n+\n+(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n+    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n+    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n+    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or\n+    as part of a Larger Work; and\n+\n+(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer\n+    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its\n+    Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n+\n+2.2. Effective Date\n+\n+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n+become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n+distributes such Contribution.\n+\n+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n+\n+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n+this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n+distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n+Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n+Contributor:\n+\n+(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n+    or\n+\n+(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n+    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n+    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n+    Version); or\n+\n+(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n+    its Contributions.\n+\n+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n+or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n+the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n+\n+2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n+\n+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n+distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n+License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n+permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n+\n+2.5. Representation\n+\n+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n+Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n+to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n+\n+2.6. Fair Use\n+\n+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n+applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n+equivalents.\n+\n+2.7. Conditions\n+\n+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n+in Section 2.1.\n+\n+3. Responsibilities\n+-------------------\n+\n+3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n+\n+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n+the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n+Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n+License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n+attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n+Form.\n+\n+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n+\n+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n+\n+(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n+    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n+    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n+    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n+    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n+\n+(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n+    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n+    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n+    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n+\n+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n+\n+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n+provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n+the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n+Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n+Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n+License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n+under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n+the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n+Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n+License(s).\n+\n+3.4. Notices\n+\n+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n+(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n+or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n+the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n+the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n+\n+3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n+\n+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n+indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n+Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n+behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n+such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n+liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n+indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n+disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n+jurisdiction.\n+\n+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n+---------------------------------------------------\n+\n+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n+License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n+statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n+the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n+describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n+be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n+Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n+or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n+recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n+\n+5. Termination\n+--------------\n+\n+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n+if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n+compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n+Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n+Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n+ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n+non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n+come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n+Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n+first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n+from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n+Your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n+counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n+directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n+You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n+2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n+\n+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n+end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n+have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n+prior to termination shall survive termination.\n+\n+************************************************************************\n+*                                                                      *\n+*  6.
