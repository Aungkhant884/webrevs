This benchmark is designed for exact automated performance regression testing and it takes several ours to execute completely. \n+ * `GroupJavacBenchmark` is grouping the measurements of all javac compilation stages into one run and its execution should take less than 30 minutes on a regular developers computer.\n+\n+Solution to speed up javac benchmarking is to select only `GroupJavacBenchmark` for execution using following command line:\n+\n+\t  $ java -jar target\/jmh-jdk-microbenchmarks-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar .*GroupJavacBenchmark.*\n","filename":"README.md","additions":41,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":41,"status":"modified"}]}
